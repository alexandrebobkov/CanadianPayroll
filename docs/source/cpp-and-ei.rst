Canada Pension Plan
-------------------

Objective of this section is to enable you to identify the following Canada Pension Plan components:

  - Who must contribute to the Canada Pension Plan
  - Types of employment subject to Canada Pension Plan contributions
  - Types of employment not subject to Canada Pension Plan contributions
  - Payments and benefits subject to Canada Pension Plan contributions
  - Payments and benefits not subject to Canada Pension Plan contributions
  - Calculate Canada Pension Plan contributions at an individual level

The **Canada Pension Plan** (CPP) is a federally legislated social insurance program established under the Canada Pension Plan 
Act. Its primary purpose is to provide financial protection to contributors and their families in the event of retirement, 
disability, or death. The program is funded through mandatory payroll deductions from employees, which are matched equally by 
employers. These employee contributions are specifically referred to as Canada Pension Plan contributions.

In addition to the CPP, employers may offer private or non-government pension plans, which may also involve payroll 
deductions from employees. The specific payroll withholding requirements for these supplementary pension plans will be discussed 
in more detail in the later chapters; it is important to note that the CPP is often one of multiple retirement savings 
vehicles available within an organization's compensation structure.

Employment Insurance
--------------------

Objective of this section is to enable you to identify the following Employment Insurance components:

  - Who must pay Employment Insurance premiums
  - Types of employment subject to Employment Insurance premiums
  - Types of employment not subject to Employment Insurance premiums
  - Payments and benefits subject to Employment Insurance premiums
  - Payments and benefits not subject to Employment Insurance premiums
  - Calculate Employment Insurance premiums at an individual level

Employment Insurance (EI) is a federally legislated social insurance program established under the Employment Insurance Act. 
It provides temporary financial support to individuals who are unemployed while seeking new employment or engaging in skill 
development. In addition to regular benefits, EI offers special provisions for workers who take leave due to significant life 
events such as illness, pregnancy, caring for a newborn or newly adopted child, supporting a critically ill or injured person, 
or tending to a family member facing a serious health condition with a risk of death.

The EI program is funded through payroll contributions made by employees, known as Employment Insurance premiums. Employers 
also contribute by paying a premium that is calculated based on their employees' deductions.

While Employment Insurance is a government-mandated program, it may not be the only insurance plan available in the workplace. 
Many organizations offer private or non-government insurance options such as life and disability coverage, which are funded by 
employers, employees, or both. Although this chapter focuses specifically on the federally legislated EI program, additional 
information about private insurance plans will be covered in the later chapters.
