CANADA PENSION PLAN AND EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE
#############################################

Membership or participation in the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Employment Insurance
Plan (EI) is compulsory for certain types of employment. As a person responsible for the payroll 
you need to know which employees must participate in these plans, what amounts to withhold
from employees and how much the employer will have to remit or send to the Canada
Revenue Agency (CRA).

Payroll plays a pivotal role in administering statutory deductions, specifically the collection and remittance of 
Canada Pension Plan (CPP) contributions and Employment Insurance (EI) premiums. These mandatory deductions, along with the 
employer's matching portion, must be accurately submitted to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) within prescribed timelines.

This chapter outlines the essential criteria used to identify pensionable and insurable earnings, and provides detailed 
guidance on calculating both employee deductions and employer contributions for regular and non-regular pay periods.

In accordance with federal legislation, CPP contributions are the **first deduction** applied to employment income, 
followed by EI premiums. Because these deductions are mandated by statute, they are classified as **statutory deductions**, 
underscoring their legal significance and the employer's obligation to ensure full compliance.

Canada Pension Plan
-------------------

Objective of this section is to enable you to identify the following Canada Pension Plan components:

  - Who must contribute to the Canada Pension Plan
  - Types of employment subject to Canada Pension Plan contributions
  - Types of employment not subject to Canada Pension Plan contributions
  - Payments and benefits subject to Canada Pension Plan contributions
  - Payments and benefits not subject to Canada Pension Plan contributions
  - Calculate Canada Pension Plan contributions at an individual level

The **Canada Pension Plan** (CPP) is a federally legislated social insurance program established under the Canada Pension Plan 
Act. Its primary purpose is to provide financial protection to contributors and their families in the event of retirement, 
disability, or death. The program is funded through mandatory payroll deductions from employees, which are matched equally by 
employers. These employee contributions are specifically referred to as Canada Pension Plan contributions.

In addition to the CPP, employers may offer private or non-government pension plans, which may also involve payroll 
deductions from employees. The specific payroll withholding requirements for these supplementary pension plans will be discussed 
in more detail in the later chapters; it is important to note that the CPP is often one of multiple retirement savings 
vehicles available within an organization's compensation structure.

.. note::

    Employers located in Quebec are responsible for deducting Québec Pension Plan (QPP) contributions, instead
    of CPP contributions, from their Québec employees and remitting those contributions to Revenu Québec (RQ). 

The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) was designed as an income replacement program for individuals who have been in pensionable 
employment during their working life. A CPP retirement pension is a monthly benefit paid to people who have contributed to 
the Canada Pension Plan. The pension is designed to replace about 25 percent of the earnings on which a person's contributions 
were based. Individuals can apply for their CPP retirement pension when they turn 60.

There are three Canada Pension Plan benefits:

  - retirement pension
  - disability benefits (for contributors with a disability and their dependent children)
  - survivor benefits (including the death benefit, the survivor's pension and the children's benefit)

The CPP operates throughout Canada while the province of Québec administers its own program for workers in Québec called the 
**Québec Pension Plan** (QPP). The two plans work together to ensure that all contributors are protected, no matter where the 
individual lives. Québec Pension Plan requirements will be covered later in this course.

Who Must Contribute to the Canada Pension Plan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CPP is a **contributory plan**. This means that all costs are covered by the financial contributions paid by employees, 
employers and self-employed workers, and from revenue earned on CPP investments. The CPP is not funded through general tax 
revenues.

Canada Pension Plan contributions must be withheld from employees who:

  1. CPP contributions must be withheld from employees who have reached the age of 18 but are under the age of 70.
  2. CPP contributions must be withheld from employees who are in pensionable employment.
  3. CPP contributions must be withheld from employees in pensionable employment who are not considered to be disabled by either Service Canada or Retraite Québec.
  4. CPP contributions must be withheld from employees who are 65 years of age but are under the age of 70 and are in receipt of the Canada or Québec Pension Plan retirement 
  pension, but have not filed an election to stop paying CPP contributions.

In principle, employees who do not fall within the categories listed previously would not make CPP contributions. However, it 
is not always clear what constitutes pensionable earnings and pensionable employment. To clarify eligibility, the CRA has 
developed a list of the types of employment that are not subject to CPP contributions. This information can also be found in 
the Employers' Guide - Payroll Deductions and Remittances - T4001, which is published by the CRA.

The following types of employment are excluded by legislation and therefore do not constitute pensionable employment. Payments arising from such employment are not subject
to CPP contributions:

  - employment in agriculture, or an agricultural enterprise, horticulture, fishing, hunting, trapping, forestry, logging, or lumbering, by an employer:
    - who pays the employee less than $250 in cash remuneration in a calendar year; or
    - employs the employee for a period of less than 25 working days in the same year on terms providing for payment of cash remuneration—the working days do not have to be consecutive


Employment Insurance
--------------------

Objective of this section is to enable you to identify the following Employment Insurance components:

  - Who must pay Employment Insurance premiums
  - Types of employment subject to Employment Insurance premiums
  - Types of employment not subject to Employment Insurance premiums
  - Payments and benefits subject to Employment Insurance premiums
  - Payments and benefits not subject to Employment Insurance premiums
  - Calculate Employment Insurance premiums at an individual level

**Employment Insurance** (EI) is a federally legislated social insurance program established under the Employment Insurance Act. 
It provides temporary financial support to individuals who are unemployed while seeking new employment or engaging in skill 
development. In addition to regular benefits, EI offers special provisions for workers who take leave due to significant life 
events such as illness, pregnancy, caring for a newborn or newly adopted child, supporting a critically ill or injured person, 
or tending to a family member facing a serious health condition with a risk of death.

The EI program is funded through payroll contributions made by employees, known as Employment Insurance premiums. Employers 
also contribute by paying a premium that is calculated based on their employees' deductions.

While Employment Insurance is a government-mandated program, it may not be the only insurance plan available in the workplace. 
Many organizations offer private or non-government insurance options such as life and disability coverage, which are funded by 
employers, employees, or both. Although this chapter focuses specifically on the federally legislated EI program, additional 
information about private insurance plans will be covered in the later chapters.

Record of Employment
---------------------

The **Record of Employment** (ROE) is the form used by Service Canada to determine an individual's qualification to collect 
Employment Insurance benefits when their employment is interrupted, how much the benefit will be and how long they will 
collect it. As payroll is responsible for completing the ROE, the form will be illustrated in this chapter, along with an
explanation of what payroll information must be tracked for ROE reporting purposes.
