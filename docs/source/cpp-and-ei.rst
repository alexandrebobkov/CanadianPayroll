Canada Pension Plan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Canada Pension Plan** (CPP) is a federally legislated social insurance program established under the Canada Pension Plan 
Act. Its primary purpose is to provide financial protection to contributors and their families in the event of retirement, 
disability, or death. The program is funded through mandatory payroll deductions from employees, which are matched equally by 
employers. These employee contributions are specifically referred to as Canada Pension Plan contributions.

In addition to the CPP, employers may offer private or non-government pension plans, which may also involve payroll 
deductions from employees. The specific payroll withholding requirements for these supplementary pension plans will be discussed 
in more detail in the later chapters; it is important to note that the CPP is often one of multiple retirement savings 
vehicles available within an organization's compensation structure.
