The Canada Revenue Agency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under the Canada Pension Plan Act and the Employment Insurance Act, the CRA is
responsible for determining:

  - whether or not an individual's employment is pensionable under the Canada Pension
Plan Act or insurable under the Employment Insurance Act

  - the types of earnings that are considered pensionable or insurable

  - how many hours an insured person has in insurable employment

  - the recovery of any debts owed as a result of an overpayment of Canada Pension
Plan, Employment Insurance, or Old Age Security benefits

The CRA is also responsible for ensuring that CPP contributions and EI premiums are
deducted, remitted and reported as required by legislation.

The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is a federal government agency that manages the
following business lines for the federal government: Tax Services and Benefit Programs.
The Tax Services business line assists over 25 million individuals, businesses, trusts, and
organizations to meet their obligations under the tax system. Each year, the CRA collects
approximately $324 billion in gross taxes and excise duties on behalf of the federal and
provincial governments - the equivalent of about $1.2 billion every working day. The CRA's
mission is to promote compliance with Canada's tax legislation and regulations through
communication, quality service, and responsible enforcement, thereby contributing to the
economic and social well-being of Canadians.

From this mission comes the CRA's mandate to:

  - collect revenues and administer tax laws for the federal government and for most provinces and territories

  - deliver various social and economic benefit incentive programs to Canadians

The CRA tracks the success of the first part of its mandate by measuring compliance in the following areas:

  - **Filing:** the CRA's goal is to have over 90% of individual and corporate income tax and registered business' goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) returns filed on time.

  - **Registration:** the CRA measures its success in this area by ensuring that the majority of all known businesses are registered for various programs including corporate income tax, GST/HST, payroll deductions, and import/export accounts.

  - **Remittance:** the CRA's goal is to have over 90% of individual and corporate tax filers pay their taxes on time.

  - **Reporting:** the CRA measures reporting compliance through the information it receives on tax documents, for example, the T4 and T4A information slips.

The CRA's program responsibilities that are specifically related to payroll include the administration of:

  - the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) (shared responsibility with Employment and Social Development Canada and Service Canada)

  - Employment Insurance (EI) (shared responsibility with Employment and Social Development Canada and Service Canada)

  - Income Tax

Each of these programs requires compliance by employers to withhold deductions from their
employees' pay for CPP contributions, EI premiums and income tax deductions. These
withholdings are termed statutory deductions as the deductions are required under legislative
statute. Statutory deductions are the first deductions to be withheld from an employee's gross
pay.

Canada Pension Plan (CPP)
--------------------------

The Canada Pension Plan became operational on January 1, 1966. The plan was fully
effective in 1976 after a ten year transitional period.
The Canada Pension Plan is a social insurance program, legislated under the federal Canada
Pension Plan Act, designed to provide protection in the form of benefits to contributors and
their families against loss of income due to retirement. 

In addition to retirement pension benefits, the plan provides supplementary benefits in the form of:

  - surviving spouse pensions
  - disability benefits
  - benefits for orphans and children of disabled contributors
  - death benefits payable upon the death of a contributor

All employers are required by law to deduct CPP contributions from pensionable earnings
paid to their employees, and to remit these deductions, along with the employer's portion, to
the CRA. The employer matches the employee's contributions dollar for dollar.

.. admonition:: EXAMPLE

    Janet Frank has $45.00 in CPP contributions deducted from her gross pay. Her employer,
    Northern Skies, must match her contribution of $45.00. A total of $90.00 in CPP contributions must be remitted to the CRA.

CPP contributions take priority over all other deductions and are therefore the first statutory
deduction to be withheld from an employee's gross pay.

Employment Insurance (EI)
--------------------------

The CRA's responsibility for the Employment Insurance program is associated with the
collection of employee and employer premiums. It also makes decisions about which types of
remuneration are considered insurable and, therefore, subject to EI premiums.
All employers are required by law to deduct EI premiums from the insurable earnings paid to
their employees, and remit these deductions, along with the employer's portion, to the CRA.
The employer's portion is 1.4 times the employee's portion.

.. admonition:: EXAMPLE

    Janet Frank has $20.00 in EI premiums deducted from her gross pay. Her employer, Northern
    Skies must contribute $28.00 ($20.00 x 1.4). A total of $48.00 in EI premiums must be
    remitted to the CRA.

EI premiums are the second statutory deduction to be withheld from an employee's pay.
Employers are also required to track the employee's insurable earnings and insurable hours
by pay period for reporting purposes, such as completing the Record of Employment for a
terminated or inactive employee.

Income Tax
----------
Income taxation began in Canada, and in many other countries, during World War I. In July
1917, the Government of Canada passed legislation which enabled the government to levy a
temporary tax on personal income. This tax was intended to help finance government
expenditures for World War I; however, it eventually became the basic tax on all incomes.

When income tax was first introduced, each person was responsible for paying their own
income tax directly to the federal government. In 1940, the federal government legislated
deductions at source, which meant that employers became responsible for withholding
income tax from remuneration paid to employees. Beginning January 1, 1962, all provinces
imposed personal income tax; prior to that date, only Québec imposed such a tax.

Income tax withholdings are calculated by applying a federal tax rate and a separate
provincial/territorial tax rate to the employee's taxable income. The employee's province of
employment determines which provincial/territorial tax rate to apply. The federal
government and all provinces and territories, except Québec, have the same definition of
taxable income.

All Canadian provinces/territories, except Québec, have entered into tax collection
agreements with the federal government. Under these agreements the CRA collects the
provincial/territorial income taxes on behalf of the provinces/territories. The CRA then
distributes the provincial/territorial income taxes it has collected through a series of transfer
payments to the provinces/territories. These transfer payments are based on the personal tax
returns filed by Canadian taxpayers.

As the federal government collects both the federal and the provincial/territorial portions of
tax from all employees working in a province/territory other than Québec, the two tax
withholdings, federal and provincial/territorial, are combined into one deduction amount. The
employee may only see one item *Income Tax* or *Federal Income Tax* listed on their pay
statement, however it is the total of two withholdings.

Québec collects its own provincial income tax. There are two separate income tax deductions
withheld from Québec employees — one for federal income tax and the other for Québec
provincial income tax. The federal income tax is remitted to the CRA and the Québec
provincial income tax is remitted to Revenu Québec (RQ). Québec employees will see
*Federal Income Tax* and *Québec Income Tax* listed separately on their pay statements.
RQ is discussed extensively in a later chapter.

Non-Compliance Penalties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If an organization fails to deduct and remit the amounts withheld from employees for CPP
contributions, EI premiums and income tax, it may be left in the position of having to pay
both the employer's and the employee's portion of deductions not taken, as well as penalties
and interest charges on the outstanding amount.

An employer who remits withholdings or deductions late is subject to the following
penalties:
  - 3% will be applied to remittances that are 1 to 3 days late
  - 5% for remittances that are 4 or 5 days late
  - 7% for remittances that are 6 or 7 days late
  - 10% for remittances that are 8 or more days late

An employer who withholds the statutory deductions but does not remit them, or fails to
deduct the required deductions, will be subject to a 10% penalty for the first occurrence on
the amount that should have been deducted and remitted. This penalty may increase to 20%
for the second and each subsequent occurrence in the same calendar year if the failure was
made knowingly or under circumstances of gross negligence. Penalties will be applied to
amounts in excess of $500; however, in the case of wilful delay or deficiency, these penalties
can be levied on amounts of less than $500.

The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) charges interest on any unpaid remittances and unpaid
penalties from the day the payment was due. The interest rate is determined every three
months, in accordance with the prescribed interest rates, and is available on the CRA
website.

As a payroll practitioner, you need to have a clear understanding of how and when to make
the required deductions and remittances to avoid these penalties and interest charges.

All monies deducted on behalf of the CRA are considered to be held “in trust” for the
Receiver General. The amount owed must be kept separate from the operating funds of the
organization. In the event of estate liquidation, assignment, receivership, or bankruptcy the
trust money for statutory deductions is still owed to the CRA.

Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), a department of the Government of
Canada, is committed to building a stronger and more competitive Canada by supporting
Canadians in making choices that help them live productive and rewarding lives and to
improve their quality of life.

To do this, the department:

  - develops policies that make Canada a society in which all can use their talents, skills and resources to participate in learning, work and their community
  - creates programs and support initiatives that help Canadians move through life's transitions—from families with children to seniors, from school to work, from one job to another, from unemployment to employment, from the workforce to retirement
  - creates better outcomes for Canadians through service excellence with Service Canada and other partners

ESDC supports human capital development and labour market development; and is dedicated
to establishing a culture of lifelong learning for Canadians. Some of their specific program
responsibilities include:

  - Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security
  - Employment Insurance
  - Employment Programs
  - Youth Employment Strategies
  - Canada Education Savings Program
  - Canada Student Loans and Grants

ESDC is responsible for matters relating to:

  - amending the regulations made under the Canada Pension Plan and the Employment *Insurance Act*
  - keeping records of each individual's CPP contributions and pensionable earnings
  - the establishment of annual maximum insurable earnings
  - the administration of provisions related to Wage Loss plans
  - the administration of provisions regarding Job Creation programs

Almost all of today's seniors receive income from Canada's public pensions. Basic financial
support is also available to survivors, people who become too disabled to work, and their
children. These pensions and benefits are delivered through the Canada Pension Plan (CPP)
and Old Age Security (OAS) programs. Together, the CPP and OAS programs provide a
modest base upon which Canadians can build their retirement income.

The amount of CPP benefits is based on an individual's CPP contributions. Employees
between the ages of 18 to 70 years old make contributions that are calculated on their annual
pensionable earnings between a minimum and a maximum amount. The minimum amount is
frozen at $3,500, while the maximum pensionable earnings are set each January, based on
increases in the average wage in Canada.

Employment Insurance (EI) is the program with the greatest impact on payroll. This program
provides temporary financial assistance for unemployed Canadians while they look for work
or upgrade their skills. It also provides coverage for Canadians who are sick, pregnant or
caring for a newborn or adopted child. Individuals who must care for a family member who
is seriously ill with a significant risk of death may also be assisted by Employment Insurance
benefits. Application of the EI rules will be looked at in more detail in another chapter.
The first Unemployment Insurance (UI) Act was passed into law in 1940, and was based on
the British Unemployment Insurance Act, 1935. Since that time, the UI Act has been repealed
and replaced four times - in 1955, 1971, 1985, and most recently in 1996. Clarifying details
on how the act is to be applied are found in the EI Regulations, which are amended as
required.

The purpose of the act is to provide income support during a temporary interruption of
earnings with the emphasis on returning the unemployed to the labour force as quickly as
possible. Contributions to the plan and the amount of benefits are based on a percentage of
insurable earnings. The ceiling on insurable earnings is reviewed annually to keep pace with
increases in average income and the cost of living. The premium rates payable by an insured
employee and the employer are also determined annually.

Service Canada
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Service Canada (SC) was created by the federal government in 2005 with the goal of
providing easy-to-access, one-stop personalized service to Canadians. The agency integrates
services from a number of federal departments to form a service delivery network. These
services often touch all aspects of the lives of Canadians: from parental and pension benefits,
to matching employers with job seekers, and obtaining a Social Insurance Number.
Service Canada serves as the government's operational arm while Employment and Social
Development Canada (ESDC) operates as the policy-making body. ESDC makes the rules
for the various programs while Service Canada delivers the programs.

Some of Service Canada's program responsibilities include:

  - the issuance of Social Insurance Numbers (SIN) and the protection and security of SIN information
  - the delivery of services to employers, including Record of Employment on the Web the administration of Employment Insurance programs to individuals, including regular, illness, pregnancy/parental, critically ill or injured person and compassionate care benefits
  - the administration of the Employment Insurance Premium Reduction program, including granting qualified employers a reduced Employment Insurance premium rate
  - the administration of Canada Pension Plan benefits, including retirement, disability, survivor, children's and death benefits
  - the administration of benefits for seniors, including the Old Age Security Program and the Guaranteed Income Supplement

Through the Canada Pension Plan program, SC administers the payment of CPP benefits. These payments have little impact on payroll. 
The biggest impact Service Canada has on
payroll is through the administration of the Record of Employment program and the Social
Insurance Number.

Payroll is responsible for deducting and remitting EI premiums on behalf of employees and
employers. They are also responsible for capturing information related to insurable earnings
and hours, and reporting that information on the Record of Employment, which is explained
in detail in a later chapter.
