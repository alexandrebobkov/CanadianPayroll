INTRODUCTION TO CANADIAN PAYROLL
####################################

Payroll is a necessary function in every organization that has employees, 
as each employee expects to be paid for the work they perform. While the 
amount of maximum remuneration that an employee receives for their work is 
not legislated by any government (unless the employee is a federal or 
provincial/territorial civil servant), there is legislation in place at
both the federal and provincial/territorial levels that governs many 
aspects of processing employees' pay, their taxable benefits and observing 
their rights as employees.

t is important to note that this course deals with payroll, the function of paying employees
for work performed for employers. Self-employed workers or contractors, who submit
invoices for the work they perform and receive payment through accounts payable and not
payroll, are not employees.

Both the federal and the Qu√©bec governments provide factors that can be used to determine
whether an employee-employer relationship exists. It is crucial to know how to determine the
type of relationship that exists between the worker and the organization and to ensure that
any payments made comply with legislation.

Payroll Objectives and Definitions
------------------------------------

The primary objective of the payroll function in every organization is to 
pay employees accurately and on time, in compliance with legislative 
requirements, for a full annual payroll cycle.

Every employee expects to receive their pay on the day it is due in the 
manner arranged with their employer, either by cheque or direct deposit. 
In addition to ensuring that employees have been paid, payroll 
practitioners must also be able to communicate payroll information to
all stakeholders.
