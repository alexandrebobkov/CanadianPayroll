INTRODUCTION TO CANADIAN PAYROLL
####################################

Payroll is a necessary function in every organization that has employees, 
as each employee expects to be paid for the work they perform. While the 
amount of maximum remuneration that an employee receives for their work is 
not legislated by any government (unless the employee is a federal or 
provincial/territorial civil servant), there is legislation in place at
both the federal and provincial/territorial levels that governs many 
aspects of processing employees' pay, their taxable benefits and observing 
their rights as employees.
