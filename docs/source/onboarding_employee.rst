##########################

In the context of Canadian payroll administration, onboarding an employee refers to the formal process of integrating a new hire into 
both the organizational and payroll systems. It ensures that the employee is properly registered, legally compliant, and ready to be paid 
accurately and on time.

Key Steps on Onboarding an Employee:

*  Collect Required Personal Information: Includes full legal name, address, date of birth, and Social Insurance Number (SIN). The SIN is critical for tax reporting to the CRA (Canada Revenue Agency).

* Obtain Federal & Provincial Tax Forms: New employees must complete Form TD1 (Federal and possibly a Provincial version) to declare tax credits and determine income tax withholdings.

* Set Up Banking Info for Direct Deposit: Employees usually provide a void cheque or bank form to set up electronic payments.

* Register the Employee in the Payroll System: Involves entering all personal and job-related data, assigning a payroll ID, and verifying employment status (e.g. full-time, part-time, contract).

* Enroll in Benefits or Pension Programs: If applicable, the employee may be signed up for group insurance, retirement savings plans (like RRSP or pension plans), and other benefits. These deductions must be accurately reflected in payroll.

* Assign Statutory Deductions that Employers must withhold and remit

   - CPP (Canada Pension Plan)

   - EI (Employment Insurance)

   - Income Tax (based on TD1 form)

* Confirm Employment Agreement & Start Date


üçÅ Compliance & Record Keeping

* Employers in Canada are responsible for keeping accurate records of employee data, pay stubs, deductions, and remittances for at least 6 years.

* If audited by CRA, these documents must be readily available.

* Employers must also provide T4 slips by end of February each year to summarize annual earnings and deductions for tax filing.

Entering Employee Information into Sage50
=========================================

To enter a new employee into the Sage 50 Payroll module (Canada edition), start by navigating to the Employees & Payroll section in the 
Home window. Right-click the Employees icon and choose "Add Employee" to begin creating employee's record. Input the employee's full legal 
name. Then, proceed to fill in the personal and payroll details across several tabs: the Personal tab for birth date and contact info, the Taxes tab to select the appropriate provincial 
tax table, the Income tab to configure their pay frequency, and the Deductions tab to define benefit or pension deductions. You'll also 
want to enter their bank details for direct deposit. For compliance, be sure to complete and store signed TD1 forms (Federal and Provincial) 
separately, as Sage50 does not automatically generate these. You'll also need to set up EI, CPP, and Income Tax deductions and link them to remittance vendors in the system. Once all 
information is reviewed for accuracy, save and close the record to finalize setup. If you prefer a guided approach, Sage50 also offers 
an Employee Wizard to walk you through these steps.

.. important::

  To maintain accuracy and compliance in Sage 50 Payroll, carefully verify that all employee information entered into the system,
  including full legal name, Social Insurance Number (SIN), residential address, and compensation details, matches the data provided on 
  official documentation such as the signed employment contract and government-issued identification (e.g. driver's licence, Employment Contract). 
  Double-checking these entries helps prevent administrative errors and ensures that payroll records remain consistent with legal and 
  regulatory standards.
