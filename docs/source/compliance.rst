Introduction
============

Payroll is a necessary function in every organization that has employees, as each employee
expects to be paid for the work they perform. While the amount of maximum remuneration
that an employee receives for their work is not legislated by any government (unless the
employee is a federal or provincial/territorial civil servant), there is legislation in place at
both the federal and provincial/territorial levels that governs many aspects of processing
employees' pay, their taxable benefits and observing their rights as employees.

It is important to note that for the scope of this course, the payroll includes the function of paying employees
for work performed for employers. Self-employed workers or contractors, who submit
invoices for the work they perform and receive payment through accounts payable and not
payroll, are not employees. This chapter illustrates how to determine if an employeeemployer relationship exists. Once an employee-employer relationship has been established,
the correct method of payment for services can be determined.

Both the federal and the Qu√©bec governments provide factors that can be used to determine
whether an employee-employer relationship exists. It is crucial to know how to determine the
type of relationship that exists between the worker and the organization and to ensure that
any payments made comply with legislation. 

What are Payroll's Objectives?
===============================

The primary objective of the payroll function in every organization is to pay employees
accurately and on time, in compliance with legislative requirements, for a full annual payroll
cycle.

Every employee expects to receive their pay on the day it is due in the manner arranged with
their employer, either by cheque or direct deposit. In addition to ensuring that employees
have been paid, payroll practitioners must also be able to communicate payroll information to
all stakeholders.
