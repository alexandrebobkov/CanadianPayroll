##################################

**LEARNING OBJECTIVES**

This chapter provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamentals of payroll compliance and regulations in Canada. 
It outlines the key stakeholders involved, the core objectives of payroll, and the legal frameworks that shape payroll 
operations. The differences between federal and provincial/territorial jurisdictions are clearly explained, with emphasis on 
how each level of government influences payroll administration. The chapter also examines the Canada Revenue Agency's 
criteria for determining whether an individual is considered an employee or self-employed, providing essential context for 
accurate classification and compliance.

Topics covered in this chapter are:

  1. Identify four uses of the term payroll
  2. Describe payroll's objectives
  3. Describe who payroll's stakeholders are
  4. Differentiate between federal and provincial/territorial jurisdictions
  5. Explain how each stakeholder affects payroll processes and procedures
  6. Apply the Canada Revenue Agency's factors for determining whether an individual is an employee or self-employed

Introduction
------------

Payroll is an essential operational function in any organization that employs staff, ensuring individuals are compensated 
appropriately for their work. The payroll process is subject to a robust framework of legislation. Both federal and 
provincial/territorial governments enact regulations that oversee various elements of payroll administration, 
including compensation practices, taxation of employee benefits, and the protection of worker rights. These legal obligations 
help establish consistency, accountability, and fairness in how employee remuneration is managed across sectors.

For the purposes of this course, payroll refers specifically to the process of compensating employees for work performed 
within the framework of an employer-employee relationship. Individuals who are self-employed or work as contractors submit 
invoices for their services and are paid through accounts payable, not through the payroll system — and therefore are not 
considered employees. This chapter explains how to assess whether a true employee-employer relationship exists. Once that 
relationship is confirmed, the appropriate method of payment can be accurately identified and applied.

Various levels of the governments offer specific criteria that help determine whether an employee-employer 
relationship is in place. Understanding the nature of this relationship is essential when evaluating a worker's status within 
an organization. Once the relationship is clearly identified, it becomes possible to ensure that payments made to the 
individual are handled in full compliance with applicable legislation. This distinction plays a vital role in payroll 
administration and helps prevent legal or financial errors tied to misclassification.

Payroll Objectives
------------------

The payroll function plays a vital role in every organization, with its primary objective being to ensure employees are 
compensated accurately and on time, in accordance with legislative requirements throughout the full annual payroll cycle.

Employees expect to receive their pay as scheduled and in the method agreed upon with their employer, whether by cheque or 
direct deposit. Beyond ensuring timely payment, payroll practitioners are also responsible for effectively communicating 
payroll-related information to all relevant stakeholders, supporting transparency, compliance, and organizational 
accountability.

**Payroll** is the process of paying employees in exchange for the services they perform. The
term payroll can refer to:
  -  the department that administers the payroll
  -  the total number of people employed by an organization
  -  the wages and salaries paid out in a year
  -  a list of employees to be paid and the amount due to each

**Legislation** refers to laws enacted by a legislative body. In Canada there are many legislative
sources that payroll practitioners must comply with at two separate levels ─ the federal and
the provincial/territorial governments. Later in the chapter we will explore the compliance
requirements for the various pieces of legislation from these sources.

**Compliance** is the observance of official requirements. For payroll, this means
performing payroll functions according to federal and provincial/territorial legislative and
non-governmental stakeholder requirements.

The legislative requirements are termed **statutory**. This means they are enacted, created, or
regulated by statute, a law enacted by the legislative branch of a government. Fines and
penalties can be imposed if an organization is not in compliance with the legislative
requirements in each jurisdiction.

When working with federal and provincial or territorial government agencies, payroll professionals must be well-versed in 
the various laws and regulations that govern payroll operations, as well as the compliance requirements specific to each. 
It is their responsibility to ensure the organization adheres to all applicable legislation, thereby minimizing the risk of 
fines or legal penalties.

In addition to government regulations, payroll practitioners must also comply with obligations set forth by non-government 
stakeholders. These may include collective agreements with unions, group insurance policies, pension plans, and other 
contractual arrangements. Maintaining compliance across all stakeholder requirements is essential to the integrity and 
effectiveness of the payroll function.

Responsibilities and Functions of Payroll
---------------------------------------------------

The responsibilities of a payroll practitioner can vary significantly based on the size and structure of the organization, 
the jurisdictions in which employees are paid, and the presence of other supporting departments such as human resources, 
finance, and administration. These factors influence both the scope and complexity of payroll duties within the organization.

In small and medium-sized organizations, payroll practitioners often take on multiple roles that would typically be divided 
among separate departments in larger companies. Their responsibilities may extend beyond payroll to include tasks such as 
employee recruitment, human resources policy development, benefits administration, accounts payable and receivable, budgeting, 
and general administrative functions. In these settings, a broad and thorough knowledge of all assigned areas is essential, 
along with an understanding of the resources available to seek advice or guidance when needed.

In contrast, larger organizations tend to maintain dedicated payroll departments, supported by separate teams for human 
resources, accounting, and administration. Even within these multi-departmental structures, payroll professionals must possess 
a strong understanding of the employee life cycle. From onboarding through to termination, each stage carries specific 
implications for pay processing and reporting, requiring close coordination and specialized expertise.

The payroll department in a large organization may have:

  - payroll administrators who are responsible for entering payroll data into the system and making required payroll remittances

  - payroll coordinators who are responsible for preparing the payroll journal entries and reconciling the payroll related accounts

  - payroll managers who manage the payroll function, the payroll staff and represent payroll at the management level

**Content Knowledge**

Payroll normally requires performing the following duties:

  - Payroll Compliance Legislation: the Income Tax Act, the Employment Insurance Act, the Canada Pension Plan Act, Employment/Labour Standards, privacy legislation, Workers' Compensation and provincial/territorial payroll-specific legislation

  - Payroll Processes: the remuneration and deduction components of payroll and how to use these components to calculate a net pay in both regular and non-regular circumstances

  - Payroll Reporting: how to calculate and remit amounts due to government agencies, insurance companies, unions and other third parties. In addition, payroll reporting includes accounting for payroll expenses and accruals to internal financial systems and federal and provincial/territorial year-end reporting.

**Technical Skills**

Payroll professionals must possess a strong set of technical skills to perform their roles effectively. These include 
proficiency in payroll software and financial systems, as well as competence in commonly used computer applications such as 
spreadsheets, databases, and word processing programs. Mastery of these tools ensures accurate processing, reporting, and 
management of payroll-related data.

As organizations evolve and adapt to new technologies and reporting requirements, payroll and business systems are frequently 
updated or replaced. Therefore, it is essential for payroll personnel to remain flexible and open to change. A successful 
payroll practitioner should demonstrate a willingness to embrace continuous learning and stay current with system upgrades and 
best practices. This adaptability not only enhances performance but also supports long-term career growth in an ever-changing 
professional landscape.

**Personal and Professional Skills**

The following personal and professional skills will assist payroll professionals in dealing with
the various stakeholders involved in the payroll process:

  - written communication skills, such as preparing employee emails and memos, management reports, policies and procedures and correspondence with various levels of government

  - verbal communication skills, to be able to respond to internal and external stakeholder inquiries

  - the ability to read, understand and interpret legal terminology found in documents such as collective agreements, benefit contracts and government regulations
  
  - excellent mathematical skills to perform various calculations

  - problem solving, decision-making, time management and organizational skills

**Behavioural and Ethical Standards**

Professional behaviour and ethical conduct are critical components of an effective payroll practitioner's skill set. In this 
role, individuals must demonstrate trustworthiness, given the constant potential for fraud. Attention to detail is essential, 
making conscientiousness a valued trait.

Payroll professionals handle sensitive personal and financial data, so discretion is non-negotiable. They must also be 
tactful when interacting with employees, particularly in conversations involving financial concerns, which may be emotionally 
charged. Perceptiveness helps practitioners understand multiple perspectives in complex situations.

The ability to work under pressure is key, especially when managing absolute deadlines. Sound judgment and common sense allow 
practitioners to identify problems quickly and implement effective solutions. Finally, maintaining objectivity and a factual 
approach when responding to questions and inquiries ensures fair and consistent communication across the organization.

Effective payroll professionals should be:

  - trustworthy, as the potential for fraud is ever present
  - conscientious, with a keen attention to detail
  - discreet, due to the confidential nature of information being handled
  - tactful in dealing with employees who can be very sensitive when discussing their financial issues
  - perceptive, able to understand all sides of an issue
  - able to work under the pressures of absolute deadlines
  - able to use common sense in order to recognize problems quickly and apply sound solutions
  - able to remain objective and maintain a factual perspective when dealing with questions and inquiries

Payroll Stakeholders
------------------------

Stakeholders refer to the individuals, groups, and organizations—both within and outside the company—that have a vested 
interest in the operations and outcomes of the payroll department. These stakeholders can be viewed as internal customers, 
and payroll practitioners are encouraged to adopt a proactive, service-oriented approach in meeting their needs and 
expectations.

Payroll management stakeholders are the federal and provincial/territorial governments, the
internal stakeholders and the external stakeholders. Internal stakeholders include employees,
employers and other departments within the organization. External stakeholders include
benefit carriers, courts, unions, pension providers, charities, third party administrators and
outsource/software vendors. 

Government Stakeholders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Government legislation establishes the rules and regulations that govern payroll practices, particularly in relation to 
employee compensation. It is therefore essential for payroll practitioners to understand both the scope and the origin of all 
payroll-related laws.

Canada is ruled by a federal government with ten largely self-governing provinces and three
territories controlled by the federal government. Payroll practitioners have to be compliant
not only with the federal government legislation, but with the provincial and territorial
governments' legislation as well.

As a result, payroll departments are directly influenced by legislative developments at both the federal and provincial or 
territorial levels, making ongoing legal awareness a critical component of payroll management.

The federal parliament has the power to make laws for the peace, order and good government
of Canada. The federal cabinet is responsible for most of the legislation introduced by
parliament, and has the sole power to prepare and introduce tax legislation involving the
expenditure of public money.

The provincial/territorial legislatures have power over direct taxation in the province or
territory for the purposes of natural resources, prisons (except for federal penitentiaries),
charitable institutions, hospitals (except marine hospitals), municipal institutions, education,
licences for provincial/territorial and municipal revenue purposes, local works, incorporation
of provincial/territorial organizations, the creation of courts and the administration of justice,
fines and penalties for breaking provincial/territorial laws.

Both the federal and provincial/territorial governments have power over agriculture,
immigration and certain aspects of natural resources. Should their laws conflict, federal law
prevails.

In the case of old age, disability, and survivor's pensions, again both the federal and
provincial/territorial governments have power. In this instance, if their laws conflict, the
provincial/territorial power prevails.

The federal government cannot transfer any of its powers to a provincial/territorial
legislature, nor can a provincial/territorial legislature transfer any of its powers to the federal
government. The federal government can, however, delegate the administration of a federal
act to a provincial/territorial agency, and a provincial/territorial legislature can delegate the
administration of a provincial/territorial act to a federal agency.

    As all provinces and territories (except Québec) have delegated the administration of the
    collection of income tax deductions to the federal government, the Canada Revenue Agency
    (CRA) collects income tax withheld from employees under both federal and
    provincial/territorial requirements. Québec collects its provincial income tax directly.

Federal Government
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Constitution Act of 1867 outlined the division of legislative power and authority between
federal and provincial/territorial jurisdictional governments. The exclusive legislative
authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to all matters regarding:

  - regulation of trade and commerce
  - Employment Insurance
  - postal service
  - fixing and providing salaries and allowances for civil and other officers of the Government of Canada
  - navigation and shipping
  - ferries between a province and any British or foreign country or between two provinces
  - criminal law, except the Constitution of Courts of Criminal Jurisdiction, but including the Procedure in Criminal Matters
  - anything not specifically assigned to the provinces under this Act

The Canada Labour Code is legislation that consolidates certain statutes respecting labour.
Part I deals with Industrial Relations, Part II deals with Occupational Health and Safety and
Part III deals with Labour Standards. The primary objective of Part III is to establish and
protect employees' and employers' rights to fair and equitable conditions of employment.
Part III provisions establish minimum requirements concerning the working conditions of
employees under federal jurisdiction in the following industries and organizations:

  - industries and undertakings of inter-provincial/territorial, national, or international nature, that is, transportation, communications, radio and television broadcasting, banking, uranium mining, grain elevators, and flour and feed operations

  - organizations whose operations have been declared for the general advantage of Canada or two or more provinces, and such Crown corporations as Canada Post Corporation, and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)

Provincial/Territorial Governments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under the Constitution Act of 1867, the exclusive legislative authority of the provinces and
territories exists over:
  - all laws regarding property and civil rights, which give the provinces/territories the authority to enact legislation to establish employment standards for working conditions
  - employment in manufacturing, mining, construction, wholesale and retail trade, service industries, local businesses and any industry or occupation not specifically covered under federal jurisdiction

Canada's division of authority between federal and provincial or territorial governments directly influences payroll 
practices, particularly in relation to employment and labour standards. These standards are governed independently by 
each province and territory, and outline key rules related to workplace conditions.

Among the issues addressed are hours of work, minimum wage, overtime eligibility, vacation entitlements, and termination pay. 
Because each jurisdiction sets its own legislation, payroll practitioners must ensure compliance with the specific 
requirements applicable to the location where the employee works. Navigating these variations is an essential aspect of 
effective and lawful payroll administration.

    **Example:**

    The Gap is a retail business with stores across Canada. The workers in each store are
    governed under the employment/labour standards legislated in the jurisdiction in which they
    work. For example, the minimum general hourly wage in effect January 1, 2020 (which is
    governed by provincial/territorial employment/labour standards) is higher in Ontario than in
    Prince Edward Island. An employee working in Ontario would receive a higher hourly
    minimum wage than an employee with the same position in Prince Edward Island.

    Employers must follow the employment/labour standards legislated by the jurisdiction in
    which their employees work, unless they are governed by federal labour standards. Federal
    labour standards apply to certain industries and organizations, regardless of where the
    employees work.

The person or persons performing the payroll function must clearly understand under which
employment/labour standards jurisdiction the employees of the organization fall.
Organizations may have some employees who fall under federal jurisdiction and another
group of employees who fall under provincial/territorial legislation.

Internal Stakeholders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Internal stakeholders are the people and departments within the organization that rely on the payroll function to operate 
effectively. They form the core audience served by payroll and include employees who depend on accurate and timely 
compensation, employers who oversee workforce management, and other internal teams—such as human resources, finance, 
and operations—that collaborate closely with payroll for data sharing, planning, and compliance. These stakeholders play a 
direct role in shaping how payroll services are delivered and supported across the organization.

**Employers** - Management may require certain information from payroll to make sound
business decisions. 

**Employees** - Employees require that their pay is received in a timely and accurate manner to
meet personal obligations. Employees must also be assured that their personal information is
kept confidential. 

**Other departments** - Many departments interact with payroll, either for information or
reporting. According to the Canadian Payroll Association's 2020 National Payroll Week
(NPW) Payroll Professional Research Survey, fifty-five percent of payroll practitioners
report through the finance department and thirty-two percent report through the human
resources department. Information such as general ledger posting, payroll and benefit costs
and salary information must flow between payroll, human resources and finance in formats
needed for their various requirements.

In addition, other departments such as contracts and manufacturing often need payroll
information for budgeting, analytical and quality purposes.

External Stakeholders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

External stakeholders are entities outside of both the organization and government that maintain a collaborative or 
service-based relationship with the payroll function. These may include benefit providers, insurance carriers, pension 
plan administrators, unions, and third-party service vendors. Although not formally part of the company or regulatory bodies, 
their involvement directly impacts payroll operations.

Ensuring compliance with external stakeholder requirements is a key duty of the payroll department. This often includes 
verifying data, meeting contractual obligations, and coordinating financial transactions. In many cases, payroll 
professionals must initiate cheque requests through accounts payable and submit accompanying documentation to these 
organizations to fulfill obligations accurately and on time. Maintaining strong communication and attention to detail with 
external partners is essential for smooth and compliant payroll administration.

**Benefit Carriers** are insurance companies that provide benefit coverage to employees.
Payroll is responsible for deducting and remitting premiums for the insurance coverage to the
carriers and for providing reports on employee enrolment and coverage levels.

**Courts and the CRA** require payroll to accurately deduct and remit amounts ordered to be
withheld through garnishments, third party demands, requirements to pay and support
deduction orders.

**Unions** require that payroll accurately deduct and remit union dues and initiation fees, and to
ensure that the terms of the collective agreement are adhered to. It is estimated that just under
one-third of the workforce in Canada belongs to a trade union. Payroll professionals must be
familiar with the role and activities of trade unions and the responsibilities of the employer
and the payroll department in a unionized environment.

**Pension Providers** are third party pension plan providers that may require payroll to provide
enrolment reports on participating employees and length of service calculations, and to remit
employee deductions and employer contributions

**Charities** have arrangements with some organizations to facilitate employee donations
through payroll deductions. Payroll is responsible for remitting these deductions to the
charity.

**Third Party Administrators** are organizations that affect the administration of the payroll
function. Examples of these external stakeholders are banking institutions or benefit
organizations that offer Group Registered Retirement Saving Plans (RRSP). Payroll is
responsible for deducting any employee contributions and remitting employer and employee
contributions to the plan administrator.

**Outsource/Software vendors** are payroll service providers or payroll software vendors that
work with the payroll department to ensure the payroll is being processed accurately and
efficiently.

Legislations and Regulations
-----------------------------

Federal and provincial/territorial legislation, and amendments to existing legislation and
regulations, can affect the operations of a payroll department, as the requirement to comply
with the new or amended legislation must be satisfied.

It is important to note the difference between legislation and regulatio. **Legislation** determines what the rules are, while **regulations** determine how the rules are to be
applied. 

The methods for calculating income tax deductions are specified by the federal government through regulations.

    *Example:*

    *The Income Tax Act*

    The legislation: Specifies that employers are required to withhold income tax from employees.

    The regulation: Specifies the taxation methods that should be used for non-periodic payments such as bonuses, retroactive pay increases, lump sum payments, etc.

    *Non-periodic bonus payments*
    
    Where a payment in respect of a bonus is made by an employer to an employee whose total remuneration (including the bonus) from the employer 
    may reasonably be expected to exceed $5,000 in the taxation year of the employee in which the payment is made, the amount to be deducted or withheld by the employer is dictated 
    through a calculation prescribed in the regulation within the Act.

Legislative changes can present significant challenges for payroll departments, especially when implemented mid-year or 
applied retroactively. These adjustments often require updates to individual payroll records, additional reconciliation 
efforts, and revisions to year-end balancing procedures, placing extra demands on payroll professionals.

Labour legislation in particular is subject to frequent modifications, including amendments, repeals, and revisions. 
Therefore, it is critical for payroll practitioners to remain informed about the laws and regulatory updates relevant to 
each jurisdiction in which their organization operates.

Legislative changes are typically communicated through public media. In larger organizations, updates may also be shared 
internally by human resources, tax specialists, or legal departments. Regardless of the organization’s size, payroll 
professionals should take a proactive role in monitoring relevant developments and ensuring that all affected parties are 
made aware of any changes. A variety of resources—such as government publications, industry newsletters, professional 
associations, and online portals—can support this ongoing effort to stay informed and maintain compliance.

The following are some of the available resources:

  - The Canadian Payroll Association offers a phone and email information service, Payroll InfoLine, for members' payroll related questions. The Association also has a website for members, www.payroll.ca, that contains guidelines, legislative updates and other useful payroll related information. As well, the Association is available on Twitter(@cdnpayroll), LinkedIn (The Canadian Payroll Association) and Facebook (@canadianpayroll).

  - The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) produces guides, publications, Income Tax Bulletins, folios and Circulars, posts news bulletins and enables participation on an electronic mailing list with e-mail alerts for new content to the Canada.ca website.

  - The Revenu Québec (RQ) website provides guides, publications, bulletins, forms, online services and enables participation on an electronic mailing list with e-mail notifications of tax news articles - https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/

  - Employment/labour standards (federal, provincial and territorial) publications and websites. Each jurisdiction has a website providing information on their employment/labour standards. For example, the websites for Alberta and Québec are: Alberta - https://www.alberta.ca/employment-standards.aspx Québec - www.cnt.gouv.qc.ca/en

  - Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) and Service Canada (SC) publications including information regarding the Employment Insurance (EI) program and the Social Insurance Number - www.canada.ca

  - CCH Canada Limited publishes a series of volumes on employment and labour law, pensions and benefits, etc., that supplies information on legislation with regular updates as changes become law - www.cch.ca

  - Carswell publishes The Canadian Payroll Manual and offers a phone and email service to subscribers - www.carswell.com

Legislative Compliance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Payroll plays a critical role not only in ensuring that employees are paid accurately and on time, but also in 
supporting and maintaining compliance with numerous government regulations. This includes legislative obligations related to 
payroll source deductions, Canada Pension Plan contributions, Employment Insurance premiums, and both federal and 
provincial/territorial income tax withholdings. When these obligations are not met, employers may face serious consequences, 
including financial penalties or legal enforcement actions designed to ensure compliance.

Penalties such as fines, interest charges, and legal sanctions often result from audits or investigations into 
non-compliance. In more severe cases, enforcement measures may include seizure of bank accounts or assets, and fines.

To monitor and enforce these requirements, government agencies utilize a range of tracking systems. Some, such as those 
used to oversee source deduction remittances, rely on strict reporting schedules that create a consistent audit trail. 
Failure to meet these time-sensitive obligations typically triggers a swift response and the imposition of penalties.

For reporting requirements that are less frequent or ongoing, the consequences of non-compliance may not be immediate. 
However, they can lead to scrutiny from auditors or other officials tasked with verifying that payroll practices align with 
current legislative standards. Payroll professionals must remain vigilant and informed to protect their organization from 
financial and legal risk.

    *Example:*

    **Record of Employment (ROE)** issuance
    Failure to issue a ROE within the established deadlines may result in a visit from an investigative officer from Service Canada.

    The Canada Revenue Agency's Pensionable and Insurable Earnings Review (PIER) is an annual compliance review system. This system utilizes the data provided on the T4 
    information slips issued at year-end to validate the amounts of CPP contributions and EI premiums deducted by employers, and identifies any remittance deficiencies.

Self-Assessment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both the federal and provincial/territorial tax systems in Canada operate on the principle of self-assessment. Under this system, taxpayers and their representatives—including employers—are responsible for accurately calculating, reporting, and remitting taxes and other required contributions by the prescribed deadlines.

The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) and Revenu Québec (RQ) serve as administrators of these systems, ensuring that individuals and organizations remain compliant and that all amounts owed are properly paid.

Importantly, both agencies acknowledge the right of taxpayers to organize their financial affairs in a way that minimizes their tax liability, provided it remains within legal boundaries. While tax planning is permitted, tax evasion—such as failing to report income, neglecting to remit amounts due, or submitting false information—is strictly prohibited and subject to enforcement actions.

The Employee-Employer Relationship
-----------------------------------

Determining the nature of the working relationship between an individual and an organization is essential in all employment situations. Whether the individual is classified as an employee or self-employed directly affects the statutory withholding requirements and the organization’s compliance with applicable legislation. To support this assessment, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) provides a set of guidelines designed to help distinguish between the two classifications. Importantly, the decision is not made by the worker but must be based on objective criteria and legal standards.

Payroll practitioners play an important role in promoting awareness of this distinction throughout the organization. By proactively communicating the significance of establishing a valid employee-employer relationship, payroll professionals help ensure that employment classifications are accurate and compliant.

Once an employee-employer relationship is confirmed, the payroll department becomes responsible for meeting compliance obligations related to statutory withholdings. This includes deducting the appropriate amounts—such as income tax, Canada Pension Plan contributions, and Employment Insurance premiums—from employee pay and remitting them to the government within the required timelines. Proper classification and adherence to these rules are key to maintaining legal and financial accountability.

Where an employee-employer relationship exists, the CRA requires the employer to:

  - register with the Canada Revenue Agency for a Business Number (BN)
  - withhold the statutory deductions of income tax, Canada Pension Plan (CPP) contributions, and Employment Insurance (EI) premiums on amounts paid to employees
  - remit the amounts withheld as well as the required employer's share of CPP contributions and EI premiums to the Canada Revenue Agency
  - report the employees' income and deductions on the appropriate information return
  - give the employees copies of their T4 slips by the end of February of the following calendar year

Information on the factors to consider when determining whether an employee-employer relationship exists can be found in the 
Canada Revenue Agency guide, Employee or Self-Employed? - RC4110. The guide is available on the CRA's website,
https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency.html.

Contract of Service (Employment)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A **contract of service** is an arrangement whereby an individual (the employee) agrees to
work on a full-time or part-time basis for an employer for a specified or indeterminate period
of time.

Under a contract of service, one party serves another in return for a salary or some other form
of remuneration.

Contract for Service (Subcontracting)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **contract for service** is a business relationship whereby one party agrees to perform certain
specific work stipulated in the contract for another party. It usually calls for the
accomplishment of a clearly defined task but does not normally require that the contracting
party do anything him/herself. A person who carries out a contract for service may be
considered a contract worker, a self-employed person or an independent contractor.

A business relationship is formed when a self-employed individual enters into a verbal or written agreement to complete 
specific work for a payer in exchange for compensation. This arrangement does not establish an employer-employee relationship; 
instead, it represents a contract for services.

Under this type of agreement, the self-employed individual is responsible for delivering a final result within an agreed 
timeframe, using methods of their own choosing. They are not subject to the direction or supervision of the payer while 
completing the work, and they retain autonomy over how tasks are executed. In most cases, the payer does not participate in 
or influence the work process, meaning control over the work lies entirely with the self-employed individual. This structure 
reflects a high level of independence and flexibility, distinguishing it clearly from traditional employment relationships.

Under a contract for service, a self-employed individual accepts both the potential for profit and the risk of financial loss. 
Prior to engagement, the individual agrees on the total cost of the work, uses personal tools and equipment, and assumes full 
responsibility for how the work is performed. This means the individual bears any unforeseen costs or challenges that arise 
during the project. Conversely, if the work is completed more efficiently than expected, the financial gain—through retained 
profits—is greater.

Organizations often utilize contracts for service when they require tasks or projects that fall outside their normal business 
operations. While the relationship between a payer and a self-employed contractor may resemble that of an employer and 
employee, there is a key distinction. In a contract for service, the payer specifies the desired outcome or deliverable, but 
not how the work should be completed. In contrast, a contract of service allows the employer to direct both the tasks and the 
method by which they are carried out, establishing a more controlled, employee-based relationship.

Under a contract for service, the payer exercises general oversight to ensure that the agreed work is completed as specified. 
However, this oversight does not extend to controlling how the work is performed. The self-employed individual retains 
autonomy over the methods used to complete the tasks. Receiving general instructions from a project manager or similar 
representative does not establish an employer-employee relationship.

An employee-employer relationship is recognized when an organization has the authority to direct and control both the work and 
the manner in which it is performed. If there is uncertainty about whether such a relationship exists, the Canada Revenue 
Agency (CRA) recommends submitting Form CPT1 — Request for a CPP/EI Ruling: Employee or Self-Employed? — to obtain 
clarification. A sample of this form can be found at the end of this section.

Independent contractors or self-employed individuals are not classified as employees if no employer-employee relationship is 
present. They typically submit invoices and receive payment through accounts payable. However, the act of submitting an 
invoice alone is not sufficient to confirm self-employment status. Proper assessment of the working relationship is essential 
sto ensure accurate classification and compliance with tax and labor regulations.

Factors Determining the Type of Contract
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CRA uses a two-step approach to examine the relationship between the worker and the
payer for relationships outside the province of Québec. The approach used for relationships
in the province of Québec will be discussed in a later chapter.

**Step 1:**
The first step is to establish what the intent was when the worker and the payer entered into
the working arrangement. Did they intend to enter into an employee-employer relationship
(contract of service) or did they intend to enter into a business relationship (contract for
service). The CRA must determine not only how the working relationship has been defined
but why it was defined that way.

**Step 2:**
The CRA then considers certain factors when determining if a contract of service or a
contract for service exists. In order to understand the working relationship and verify that the
intent of the worker and the payer is reflected in the facts, they will ask a series of questions
that relate to the following factors:

 - the level of control the payer has over the worker
 - whether or not the worker provides the tools and equipment
 - whether the worker can subcontract the work or hire assistants
 - the degree of financial risk taken by the worker
 - the degree of responsibility for investment and management held by the worker
 - the worker's opportunity for profit
 - any other relevant factors, such as written contracts

The CRA will look at the answers independently and then together and consider whether or
not they reflect the intent that was originally stated. Considered individually, the response to
each of these questions is not conclusive; however, when weighed together, certain
conclusions may be drawn. When there is no common intent, the CRA will decide if the
answers are more consistent with a contract of service or a contract for service.
Each of these factors will be discussed in the material and indicators showing whether the
worker is an employee or self-employed will be provided.

Control
~~~~~~~

One of the key factors in determining a worker's status is the extent to which the payer has the ability, authority, or 
right to control both what work is performed and how it is carried out. Equally important is the level of independence the 
worker maintains in performing their duties.

In evaluating the relationship, both the payer's oversight of the worker's day-to-day activities and their overall 
influence are assessed. However, it is the payer's right to exercise control—rather than whether that control is actively 
used—that holds the most weight in determining the nature of the working relationship.

Worker is an *Employee* when:

  - The relationship is one of subordination.
  - The payer will often direct, scrutinize, and effectively control many elements of how the work is performed.
  - The payer controls both the results of the work and the method used to do the work.
  - The payer determines what jobs the worker will do.
  - The worker receives training or direction from the payer on how to do the work. 

Worker is a *Self-Employed* when:

  - Individual usually works independently, does not have anyone overseeing them.
  - The worker is usually free to work when and for whom they choose and may provide their services to different payers at the same time.
  - The worker can accept or refuse work from the payer.
  - The working relationship between the payer and the worker does not present a degree of continuity, loyalty, security, subordination, or integration.

Tools and Equipment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ownership of tools and equipment is not a definitive factor in determining the nature of a working relationship or the type of contract in place. While self-employed individuals often use their own tools to fulfill contractual obligations—making such ownership common in business relationships—this alone does not confirm self-employment. Employees may also be required to supply their own tools, depending on the trade or occupation.

In typical employee-employer relationships, the employer provides the necessary equipment and assumes the costs associated with its use, including maintenance, insurance, transportation, rental fees, and operational expenses such as fuel. However, in certain industries—such as automotive repair, painting, carpentry, and technical fields like software development or surveying—it is standard practice for employees to use their own tools or specialized instruments.

In contrast, self-employed individuals not only supply their own equipment but also bear the associated costs. Significant financial investment in tools—especially those that require ongoing maintenance or replacement—can suggest a business relationship, as these individuals assume both the potential for profit and the risk of loss.

Ultimately, the key consideration is the scale of the investment and the financial responsibility related to repairs, replacement, and insurance, rather than mere ownership itself.

The worker is an employee when:

  - The payer supplies most of the tools and equipment. 
  - The payer retains the right of use over the tools and equipment provided to the worker.
  - The worker supplies the tools and equipment and the payer reimburses the worker for their use

The worker is a self-employed individual when:

  - The worker provides the tools and equipment required and is responsible for the cost of repairs, insurance and maintenance and retains the right over the use of these assets.
  - The worker supplies his or her own workspace, is responsible for the costs to maintain it, and does substantial work from that site.

Subcontracting Work or Hiring Assistants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As subcontracting work or hiring assistants can affect a worker's chance of profit or risk of loss, this can help determine the type of business relationship. 

The worker is an employee when:

  - The worker cannot hire helpers or assistants.
  - The worker must perform the services personally.

The worker is a self-employed individual when:

  - The worker does not have to perform the service personally.
  - They can hire another party to complete the work, without consulting with the payer.

Financial Risk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CRA will examine if there are any fixed ongoing costs incurred by the worker or any
expenses that are not reimbursed. Employers will usually reimburse employees for any
expenses incurred in the performance of their job. Self-employed individuals can have
financial risk and incur losses as they usually have ongoing monthly expenses whether or not
work is being performed. Both employees and self-employed individuals may be reimbursed
for business or travel expenses, however it is the expenses that are not reimbursed that are
examined.

The worker is an employee when:

 - The worker is not usually responsible for any operating expenses.
 - The worker is not financially liable if he or she does not fulfill the obligations of the contract.
 - The payer determines and controls the method and amount of pay.

The worker is a self-employed individual when:

  - The worker is financially liable if he or she does not fulfill the obligations of the contract.
  - The worker does not receive any protection or benefits from the payer.
  - The worker hires helpers to assist and pays them.
  - The worker advertises the services offered.

Responsibility for Investment and Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the worker is required to make an investment in order to provide the services, this is
evidence that a business relationship may exist. Another factor indicating the existence of a
contract for service is if the worker is responsible for making the business decisions that
affect their profits or losses.

The worker is an employee when:

  - The worker has no capital investment in the business.
  - The worker does not have a business presence.

The worker is a self-employed individual when:

  - The worker has capital investment, manages his or her staff, hires and pays individuals to help perform the work, and has established a business presence.

Opportunity for Profit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A business relationship likely exists where the worker can realize a profit or incur a loss as
this indicates the worker controls the business aspects of the services rendered. Selfemployed individuals have the ability to accept contracts as they wish. They can negotiate
the rate for their work and can accept more than one contract at the same time. In order to
carry out the terms and conditions of their contract, they often incur expenses which they
must manage to increase their profit.

Employees normally do not have a chance of profit or a risk of loss. While some employees
who are paid by commission have an opportunity to increase their earnings based on their
sales, this is not a profit as it is not an excess of income over expenses. As well, employees
generally do not share in profits or suffer losses incurred by the business they work for.

The CRA will look at the degree to which the worker can control their revenues and
expenses. They will also look at the method of payment. Employees are typically guaranteed
their earnings according to an established rate (hourly, daily, weekly, annual) and pay
frequency. While self-employed individuals may be paid on an hourly basis, if they are paid
a flat rate for the work performed, it generally indicates a business relationship, especially if
they incur expenses while performing the services.

The worker is an employee when:

  - The worker is not in a position to realize a business profit or loss.
  - The worker is entitled to benefit plans that are normally only offered to employees.

The worker is a self-employed individual when:

  - The worker is compensated by a flat fee.
  - The worker can hire and pay a substitute.

The worker is an employee when:

The worker is a self-employed individual when:

Review Summary
--------------

The primary objective of the payroll function in every organization is to ensure that employees are paid accurately 
and on time, in full compliance with legislative requirements, throughout the entire annual payroll cycle. This function is 
critical to maintaining employee satisfaction, legal integrity, and operational efficiency.

Payroll itself is the process of compensating employees for the services they perform. It encompasses calculating wages, 
deducting taxes and benefits, and distributing payments. Ensuring accuracy in this process is essential to avoid financial 
discrepancies and maintain trust within the organization.

Legislation refers to the laws enacted by a legislative body that govern payroll practices. These laws may include tax 
regulations, labor standards, and employment rights, all of which must be adhered to by the payroll department. Compliance, 
in this context, means observing and fulfilling these official requirements to avoid legal penalties and ensure ethical 
operations.

A payroll practitioner's knowledge base includes a thorough understanding of payroll compliance legislation, payroll 
processes, and payroll reporting. In addition to technical expertise, practitioners must also possess strong personal and 
professional skills to manage responsibilities effectively and adapt to evolving regulatory environments.

Stakeholders are the individuals, groups, and agencies—both internal and external to the organization—who have a vested 
interest in the function and output of the payroll department. Their involvement and expectations influence how payroll is 
managed, ensuring that it aligns with organizational goals and legal obligations.

Payroll management stakeholders include federal and provincial/territorial governments, internal stakeholders, and external 
stakeholders. Internal stakeholders consist of employees, employers, and other departments within the organization, all of 
whom rely on accurate and timely payroll services. External stakeholders encompass benefit carriers, courts, unions, pension 
providers, charities, third-party administrators, and outsource or software vendors. These entities interact with payroll 
data and processes, often requiring coordination and compliance.

The federal parliament holds the authority to enact laws for the peace, order, and good government of Canada. It exercises 
control over industries and undertakings that are inter-provincial, national, or international in nature, as well as 
rganizations deemed to serve the general advantage of Canada or multiple provinces, including Crown corporations. 
In contrast, provincial and territorial legislatures have jurisdiction over direct taxation for regional purposes and laws 
concerning property, civil rights, and employment in sectors such as manufacturing, mining, construction, wholesale and 
retail trade, service industries, and local businesses. Any industry or occupation not specifically under federal 
jurisdiction falls within provincial or territorial control.

Employers are required to adhere to the employment and labour standards legislated by the jurisdiction in which their 
employees work, unless they are governed by federal labour standards. Where legislation mandates employer compliance, 
financial penalties or legal action may be imposed to enforce adherence and promote accountability.

A contract of service is an arrangement in which an individual, referred to as the employee, agrees to work either full-time or part-time for an employer over a specified or indeterminate period. This type of contract establishes an employer-employee relationship, where the employer typically has control over the work performed and the conditions under which it is carried out.

In contrast, a contract for service defines a business relationship where one party agrees to perform specific tasks or services outlined in the contract for another party. This arrangement is more independent in nature and does not constitute an employer-employee relationship. Instead, it reflects a client-contractor dynamic.

To determine the nature of the relationship between a worker and a payer—particularly outside the province of Québec—the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) applies a two-step approach. One of the key factors considered is the payer’s right to exercise control over the worker, including how the work is done and what tasks are performed. The degree of independence the worker holds is also evaluated, but the central issue is whether the payer has the authority to direct the work.

Another factor the CRA examines is the ownership of tools and equipment. The significance lies in the size of the investment made by the worker, as well as the costs associated with repair, replacement, and insurance. The CRA also considers whether the worker incurs fixed ongoing costs or unreimbursed expenses, which may indicate a greater level of independence.

Finally, the CRA assesses the extent to which the worker can control their revenue and expenses. A higher degree of financial control typically suggests a contract for service, while limited control may point to a contract of service. These factors collectively help determine the correct classification of the working relationship for tax and legal purposes.

Review Questions
----------------

What is the primary objective of the payroll department?

    The primary objective of the payroll department is to pay employees accurately and
    on time, in compliance with the legislative requirements for a full annual payroll
    cycle.

List four definitions of payroll.

    - the department that administers the payroll
    - the total number of people employed by an organization
    - the wages and salaries paid out in a year
    - a list of employees to be paid and the amount due to each

List the three types of payroll management stakeholders and provide an example of each.

    Payroll management stakeholders are government (federal and provincial/territorial), internal 
    (employees, employers and other departments) and external (benefit carriers, courts, unions, pension 
    providers, charities, third party administrators and outsource/software vendors).

Explain the difference between legislation and regulation.

    Legislation determines what the rules are, while regulations determine how the rules are to be applied. 

What are two examples of sources of information that you use (or could use) to keep upto-date on payroll compliance changes?

    The Canadian Payroll Association offers Payroll InfoLine, a phone-in and e-mail information service for members

      - The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) produces guides, publications and Income Tax Bulletins, folios and Circulars, posts news bulletins and enables 
      participation on an electronic mailing list with e-mail alerts for new content to the site
      - The Revenu Québec (RQ) website provides guides, publications, bulletins, forms, online services and enables participation on an electronic mailing list with e-mail notifications of tax news articles 
      - Employment/labour standards (federal, provincial and territorial) publications and websites
      - Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) and Service Canada (SC) publications including information regarding the Employment Insurance (EI) program and the Social Insurance Number
      - CCH Canada Limited publishes a series of volumes on employment and labour law, pensions and benefits, etc., that supplies information on legislation with regular updates as changes become law
      - Carswell publishes The Canadian Payroll Manual and offers a phone-in service to subscribers

    Copies of legislation are available from the printing offices of the federal, provincial and territorial governments as well as through government websites. 

List three external stakeholders and explain their compliance requirements. 

    Benefit Carriers - Payroll is responsible for deducting and remitting premiums for the insurance coverage to the carriers and for providing reports on employee enrolment and coverage levels.
    Courts and the CRA - Payroll must accurately deduct and remit amounts ordered to be withheld through garnishments, third party demands, requirements to pay and support deduction orders.
    Unions - Payroll must accurately deduct and remit union dues and initiation fees, and ensure that the terms of the collective agreement are adhered to.
    Pension Providers - Third party pension plan providers may require payroll to provide enrolment reports on participating employees and length of service calculations, and to remit employee deductions and employer contributions.

Indicate the jurisdiction the following employees fall under:

  - Canada Post Corporation (F)
  - An insurance company (P)
  - A uranium mining company (F)
  - Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (F)
  - A retail department store with locations in every province (P)
  - A chartered bank (F)

What is the difference between a contract of service and a contract for service? 

    A contract of service is an arrangement whereby an individual (the employee) agrees to work on a full-time or part-time basis for an employer for a specified or indeterminate period of time.
    
    A contract for service is a business relationship whereby one party agrees to perform certain specific work stipulated in the contract for another party. 

What are the factors that the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) considers when
determining if a contract of service or a contract for service exists? 

Please consider the following scenario.

    You are a payroll professional working for a large manufacturing company. Your
    organization has had many change initiatives over the last number of years including
    three mergers and two large group terminations. Your company endorses the use of
    consultants rather than growing the number of permanent employees.

    Write a memo to your supervisor, who is the Chief Financial Officer of the company, to
    explain why your role must coordinate with the Accounts Payable Department to ensure
    that these payments are being handled correctly. Please prepare your answer in a separate
    document. 

    *At the last weekly Finance meeting, Tom and I discussed the increase in the number of contractor invoices being 
    processed through accounts payable (AP). We have some concerns as to whether these individuals would be considered truly 
    selfemployed by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), or whether the CRA would determine them to be employees.*

    *If the worker is considered self-employed, then payment, on submission of an invoice, will continue to be handled by AP. If, however, the worker is considered an
    employee, they would have to be set up on payroll, as they would be in receipt of income from employment, subject to all legislated statutory withholdings.*

    *I have attached the CRA's form Request for a CPP/EI Ruling - Employee or SelfEmployed? - CPT1 for your information. This form can be completed by the 
    company and sent with supporting documentation, such as the terms and conditions of the contract, for a ruling from the CRA on the individual's status.*

    *I think that Payroll must coordinate with the Accounts Payable Department to ensure that these payments are being handled correctly.*

    *Tom and I would be pleased to meet with you to ensure the company is in
    compliance with all legislative requirements. Would you be available next Friday
    morning at 10:00 to discuss?*
