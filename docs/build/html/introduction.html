<h1><span class="section-number">2. </span>INTRODUCTION TO CANADIAN PAYROLL<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-canadian-payroll" title="Link to this heading">¬∂</a></h1>
<p>Payroll is a necessary function in every organization that has employees,
as each employee expects to be paid for the work they perform. While the
amount of maximum remuneration that an employee receives for their work is
not legislated by any government (unless the employee is a federal or
provincial/territorial civil servant), there is legislation in place at
both the federal and provincial/territorial levels that governs many
aspects of processing employees‚Äô pay, their taxable benefits and observing
their rights as employees.</p>
<p>t is important to note that this course deals with payroll, the function of paying employees
for work performed for employers. Self-employed workers or contractors, who submit
invoices for the work they perform and receive payment through accounts payable and not
payroll, are not employees.</p>
<p>Both the federal and the Qu√©bec governments provide factors that can be used to determine
whether an employee-employer relationship exists. It is crucial to know how to determine the
type of relationship that exists between the worker and the organization and to ensure that
any payments made comply with legislation.</p>
<section id="payroll-objectives-and-definitions">
<h2><span class="section-number">2.1. </span>Payroll Objectives and Definitions<a class="headerlink" href="#payroll-objectives-and-definitions" title="Link to this heading">¬∂</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>primary objective of the payroll function</strong> in every organization is to
pay employees accurately and on time, in compliance with legislative
requirements, for a full annual payroll cycle.</p>
<p>Every employee expects to receive their pay on the day it is due in the
manner arranged with their employer, either by cheque or direct deposit.
In addition to ensuring that employees have been paid, payroll
practitioners must also be able to communicate payroll information to
all stakeholders.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Payroll</strong> is the process of paying employees in exchange for the services</p></li>
</ul>
<p>they perform.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Legislation</strong> refers to laws enacted by a legislative body. In Canada</p></li>
</ul>
<p>there are many legislative sources that payroll practitioners must comply
with at two separate levels ‚îÄ the federal and the provincial/territorial
governments. Later in the chapter we will explore the compliance
requirements for the various pieces of legislation from these sources.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Compliance</strong> is the observance of official requirements. For payroll</p></li>
</ul>
<p>practitioners, this means performing payroll functions according to
federal and provincial/territorial legislative and non-governmental
stakeholder requirements.</p>
<p>The legislative requirements are termed <strong>statutory</strong>. This means they are
enacted, created, or regulated by statute, a law enacted by the legislative
branch of a government. Fines and penalties can be imposed if an organization
is not in compliance with the legislative requirements in each jurisdiction.</p>
<p>When dealing with federal and provincial/territorial government agencies,
payroll administrator must know the many pieces of legislation that
regulate their work and the compliance requirements associated with each.
Payroll administrators are responsible for ensuring their organization is
compliant with all payroll related legislation, thus eliminating the
potential for any fines or penalties.</p>
<p>In payroll, there are also compliance requirements from other non-government stakeholders,
for example, union collective agreements or group insurance policies. Payroll administrator
must therefore ensure the organization is compliant with all stakeholder requirements.</p>
<p>The responsibilities of the payroll administrator will differ depending on
the size of the organization, the number of jurisdictions in which they pay,
the reporting structure under which they work, and whether there are other
related departments, such as human resources, finance and administration in
the organization.</p>
<p>Small and medium-sized organizations may have payroll administrators whose
positions include other functions that, in a larger organization, would
fall under other departments. This payroll practitioner may be required to
handle multiple tasks, such as employee recruitment, human resource policy
development, benefits administration, accounts payable, accounts receivable,
budgets and/or administration.</p>
<p>Larger organizations may have a distinct payroll department with specific
payroll positions, in addition to separate human resources, accounting and
administration groups. Even in a multi-departmental organization, payroll
administrators must have knowledge of the various stages of the life cycle
of an employee. From hiring through termination of employment, many of
these stages will impact how to produce the employee‚Äôs pay and prepare
required reports.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>The payroll department in a large organization may have:</dt><dd><ul class="simple">
<li><p>payroll administrators who are responsible for entering payroll data into the system</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>and making required payroll remittances</dt><dd><ul class="simple">

regular and non-regular circumstances
- <strong>Payroll Reporting</strong>: how to calculate and remit amounts due to

<section id="technical-skills">

<p>The technical skills required by payroll professionals include proficiency in
computer programs such as payroll software and financial systems,
spreadsheets, databases and word processing.</p>
<p>Organizations often change their payroll and business systems to meet new
technology requirements and corporate reporting needs. It is important for
payroll personnel to have the ability to be adaptable to changing systems.
As a payroll practitioner, you must be prepared and willing to embrace
continuous learning.</p>
