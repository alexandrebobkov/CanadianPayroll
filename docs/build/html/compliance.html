<section id="introduction">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.1.1. </span>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Link to this heading">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>Payroll is a necessary function in every organization that has employees, as each employee
expects to be paid for the work they perform. While the amount of maximum remuneration
that an employee receives for their work is not legislated by any government (unless the
employee is a federal or provincial/territorial civil servant), there is legislation in place at
both the federal and provincial/territorial levels that governs many aspects of processing
employees‚Äô pay, their taxable benefits and observing their rights as employees.</p>
<p>It is important to note that for the scope of this course, the payroll includes the function of paying employees
for work performed for employers. Self-employed workers or contractors, who submit
invoices for the work they perform and receive payment through accounts payable and not
payroll, are not employees. This chapter illustrates how to determine if an employeeemployer relationship exists. Once an employee-employer relationship has been established,
the correct method of payment for services can be determined.</p>
<p>Both the federal and the Qu√©bec governments provide factors that can be used to determine
whether an employee-employer relationship exists. It is crucial to know how to determine the
type of relationship that exists between the worker and the organization and to ensure that
any payments made comply with legislation.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-are-the-payroll-s-objectives">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.1.2. </span>2. What are the Payroll‚Äôs Objectives?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-the-payroll-s-objectives" title="Link to this heading">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>The primary objective of the payroll function in every organization is to pay employees
accurately and on time, in compliance with legislative requirements, for a full annual payroll
cycle.</p>
<p>Every employee expects to receive their pay on the day it is due in the manner arranged with
their employer, either by cheque or direct deposit. In addition to ensuring that employees
have been paid, payroll practitioners must also be able to communicate payroll information to
all stakeholders.</p>
<p><strong>Payroll</strong> is the process of paying employees in exchange for the services they perform. The
term payroll can refer to:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>the department that administers the payroll</p></li>
<li><p>the total number of people employed by an organization</p></li>
<li><p>the wages and salaries paid out in a year</p></li>
<li><p>a list of employees to be paid and the amount due to each</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Legislation</strong> refers to laws enacted by a legislative body. In Canada there are many legislative
sources that payroll practitioners must comply with at two separate levels ‚îÄ the federal and
the provincial/territorial governments. Later in the chapter we will explore the compliance
requirements for the various pieces of legislation from these sources.</p>
<p><strong>Compliance</strong> is the observance of official requirements. For payroll practitioners, this means
performing payroll functions according to federal and provincial/territorial legislative and
non-governmental stakeholder requirements.</p>
<p>The legislative requirements are termed statutory. This means they are enacted, created, or
regulated by statute, a law enacted by the legislative branch of a government. Fines and
penalties can be imposed if an organization is not in compliance with the legislative
requirements in each jurisdiction.</p>
<p>When dealing with federal and provincial/territorial government agencies, payroll
practitioners must know the many pieces of legislation that regulate their work and the
compliance requirements associated with each. Payroll practitioners are responsible for
ensuring their organization is compliant with all payroll related legislation, thus eliminating
the potential for any fines or penalties.</p>
<p>In payroll, there are also compliance requirements from other non-government stakeholders,
for example, union collective agreements or group insurance policies. Payroll practitioners
must therefore ensure the organization is compliant with all stakeholder requirements.</p>

<section id="what-are-the-responsibilities-of-payroll-function">
<h2><span class="section-number">4.2. </span>What are the Responsibilities of Payroll Function?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-the-responsibilities-of-payroll-function" title="Link to this heading">¬∂</a></h2>
<p>The responsibilities of the payroll practitioner will differ depending on the size of the
organization, the number of jurisdictions in which they pay, the reporting structure under
which they work, and whether there are other related departments, such as human resources,
finance and administration in the organization.</p>
<p>Small and medium-sized organizations may have payroll practitioners whose positions
include other functions that, in a larger organization, would fall under other departments.
This payroll practitioner may be required to handle multiple tasks, such as employee
recruitment, human resource policy development, benefits administration, accounts payable,
accounts receivable, budgets and/or administration. These practitioners must have excellent
knowledge of all areas for which they are responsible and be aware of the resources available
to provide advice and information.</p>
<p>Larger organizations may have a distinct payroll department with specific payroll positions,
in addition to separate human resources, accounting and administration groups. Even in a
multi-departmental organization, payroll practitioners must have knowledge of the various
stages of the life cycle of an employee. From hiring through termination of employment,
many of these stages will impact how to produce the employee‚Äôs pay and prepare required
reports.</p>
<p>The payroll department in a large organization may have:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>payroll administrators who are responsible for entering payroll data into the system and making required payroll remittances</p></li>
<li><p>payroll coordinators who are responsible for preparing the payroll journal entries and reconciling the payroll related accounts</p></li>
<li><p>payroll managers who manage the payroll function, the payroll staff and represent payroll at the management level</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Payroll practitioners should know the following to effectively perform their duties:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Payroll Compliance Legislation: the Income Tax Act, the Employment Insurance Act, the Canada Pension Plan Act, Employment/Labour Standards, privacy legislation, Workers‚Äô Compensation and provincial/territorial payroll-specific legislation</p></li>
<li><p>Payroll Processes: the remuneration and deduction components of payroll and how to use these components to calculate a net pay in both regular and non-regular circumstances</p></li>
<li><p>Payroll Reporting: how to calculate and remit amounts due to government agencies, insurance companies, unions and other third parties. In addition, payroll reporting includes accounting for payroll expenses and accruals to internal financial systems and federal and provincial/territorial year-end reporting.</p></li>

<section id="technical-skills">
<h2><span class="section-number">4.4. </span>Technical Skills<a class="headerlink" href="#technical-skills" title="Link to this heading">¬∂</a></h2>
<p>The technical skills required by payroll professionals include proficiency in computer
programs such as payroll software and financial systems, spreadsheets, databases and word
processing.</p>
<p>Organizations often change their payroll and business systems to meet new technology
requirements and corporate reporting needs. It is important for payroll personnel to have the
ability to be adaptable to changing systems. As a payroll practitioner, you must be prepared
and willing to embrace continuous learning.</p>

<p>Behaviour and ethics are two areas that build on the skills that an effective payroll practitioner
must have. Effective payroll professionals should be:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>trustworthy, as the potential for fraud is ever present</p></li>
<li><p>conscientious, with a keen attention to detail</p></li>
<li><p>discreet, due to the confidential nature of information being handled</p></li>
<li><p>tactful in dealing with employees who can be very sensitive when discussing their financial issues</p></li>
<li><p>perceptive, able to understand all sides of an issue</p></li>
<li><p>able to work under the pressures of absolute deadlines</p></li>
<li><p>able to use common sense in order to recognize problems quickly and apply sound solutions</p></li>
<li><p>able to remain objective and maintain a factual perspective when dealing with questions and inquiries</p></li>

<section id="payroll-stakeholders">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.6.1. </span>3. Payroll Stakeholders<a class="headerlink" href="#payroll-stakeholders" title="Link to this heading">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>Stakeholders are the individuals, groups and agencies, both internal and external to the
organization, who share an interest in the function and output of the payroll department.
Stakeholders can be considered customers of the payroll department and payroll practitioners
can take a proactive customer service approach to serving these individuals and groups.</p>
<p>Payroll management stakeholders are the federal and provincial/territorial governments, the
internal stakeholders and the external stakeholders. Internal stakeholders include employees,
employers and other departments within the organization. External stakeholders include
benefit carriers, courts, unions, pension providers, charities, third party administrators and
outsource/software vendors.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="government-stakeholders">
<h2><span class="section-number">4.7. </span>Government Stakeholders<a class="headerlink" href="#government-stakeholders" title="Link to this heading">¬∂</a></h2>
<p>Government legislation provides the rules and regulations that the payroll function must
administer with respect to payments made to employees. For this reason, it is important for
the payroll practitioner to understand both the scope and the source of payroll-related
legislation.</p>
<p>Canada is ruled by a federal government with ten largely self-governing provinces and three
territories controlled by the federal government. Payroll practitioners have to be compliant
not only with the federal government legislation, but with the provincial and territorial
governments‚Äô legislation as well.</p>
<p>As a result, payroll practitioners and their organizations are affected by the enactment of
legislation at both the federal and provincial/territorial level.</p>
<p>The federal parliament has the power to make laws for the peace, order and good government
of Canada. The federal cabinet is responsible for most of the legislation introduced by
parliament, and has the sole power to prepare and introduce tax legislation involving the
expenditure of public money.</p>
<p>The provincial/territorial legislatures have power over direct taxation in the province or
territory for the purposes of natural resources, prisons (except for federal penitentiaries),
charitable institutions, hospitals (except marine hospitals), municipal institutions, education,
licences for provincial/territorial and municipal revenue purposes, local works, incorporation
of provincial/territorial organizations, the creation of courts and the administration of justice,
fines and penalties for breaking provincial/territorial laws.</p>
<p>Both the federal and provincial/territorial governments have power over agriculture,
immigration and certain aspects of natural resources. Should their laws conflict, federal law
prevails.</p>
<p>In the case of old age, disability, and survivor‚Äôs pensions, again both the federal and
provincial/territorial governments have power. In this instance, if their laws conflict, the
provincial/territorial power prevails.</p>
<p>The federal government cannot transfer any of its powers to a provincial/territorial
legislature, nor can a provincial/territorial legislature transfer any of its powers to the federal
government. The federal government can, however, delegate the administration of a federal
act to a provincial/territorial agency, and a provincial/territorial legislature can delegate the
administration of a provincial/territorial act to a federal agency.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>As all provinces and territories (except Qu√©bec) have delegated the administration of the
collection of income tax deductions to the federal government, the Canada Revenue Agency
(CRA) collects income tax withheld from employees under both federal and
provincial/territorial requirements. Qu√©bec collects its provincial income tax directly.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The Constitution Act of 1867 outlined the division of legislative power and authority between
federal and provincial/territorial jurisdictional governments. The exclusive legislative
authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to all matters regarding:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>regulation of trade and commerce</p></li>
<li><p>Employment Insurance</p></li>
<li><p>postal service</p></li>
<li><p>fixing and providing salaries and allowances for civil and other officers of the Government of Canada</p></li>
<li><p>navigation and shipping</p></li>
<li><p>ferries between a province and any British or foreign country or between two provinces</p></li>
<li><p>criminal law, except the Constitution of Courts of Criminal Jurisdiction, but including the Procedure in Criminal Matters</p></li>
<li><p>anything not specifically assigned to the provinces under this Act</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The Canada Labour Code is legislation that consolidates certain statutes respecting labour.
Part I deals with Industrial Relations, Part II deals with Occupational Health and Safety and
Part III deals with Labour Standards. The primary objective of Part III is to establish and
protect employees‚Äô and employers‚Äô rights to fair and equitable conditions of employment.
Part III provisions establish minimum requirements concerning the working conditions of
employees under federal jurisdiction in the following industries and organizations:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>industries and undertakings of inter-provincial/territorial, national, or international nature, that is, transportation, communications, radio and television broadcasting, banking, uranium mining, grain elevators, and flour and feed operations</p></li>
<li><p>organizations whose operations have been declared for the general advantage of Canada or two or more provinces, and such Crown corporations as Canada Post Corporation, and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<section id="review-summary">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.7.1. </span>Review Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#review-summary" title="Link to this heading">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>The primary objective of the payroll function in every organization is to ensure that employees are paid accurately
and on time, in full compliance with legislative requirements, throughout the entire annual payroll cycle. This function is
critical to maintaining employee satisfaction, legal integrity, and operational efficiency.</p>
<p>Payroll itself is the process of compensating employees for the services they perform. It encompasses calculating wages,
deducting taxes and benefits, and distributing payments. Ensuring accuracy in this process is essential to avoid financial
discrepancies and maintain trust within the organization.</p>
<p>Legislation refers to the laws enacted by a legislative body that govern payroll practices. These laws may include tax
regulations, labor standards, and employment rights, all of which must be adhered to by the payroll department. Compliance,
in this context, means observing and fulfilling these official requirements to avoid legal penalties and ensure ethical
operations.</p>
<p>A payroll practitioner‚Äôs knowledge base includes a thorough understanding of payroll compliance legislation, payroll
processes, and payroll reporting. In addition to technical expertise, practitioners must also possess strong personal and
professional skills to manage responsibilities effectively and adapt to evolving regulatory environments.</p>
