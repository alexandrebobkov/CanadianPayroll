  <p>Membership or participation in the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Employment Insurance
Plan (EI) is compulsory for certain types of employment. As a person responsible for the payroll
you need to know which employees must participate in these plans, what amounts to withhold
from employees and how much the employer will have to remit or send to the Canada
Revenue Agency (CRA).</p>
<p>Payroll plays a pivotal role in administering statutory deductions, specifically the collection and remittance of
Canada Pension Plan (CPP) contributions and Employment Insurance (EI) premiums. These mandatory deductions, along with the
employer‚Äôs matching portion, must be accurately submitted to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) within prescribed timelines.</p>
<p>This chapter outlines the essential criteria used to identify pensionable and insurable earnings, and provides detailed
guidance on calculating both employee deductions and employer contributions for regular and non-regular pay periods.</p>
<p>In accordance with federal legislation, CPP contributions are the <strong>first deduction</strong> applied to employment income,
followed by EI premiums. Because these deductions are mandated by statute, they are classified as <strong>statutory deductions</strong>,
underscoring their legal significance and the employer‚Äôs obligation to ensure full compliance.</p>

<p>The <strong>Canada Pension Plan</strong> (CPP) is a federally legislated social insurance program established under the Canada Pension Plan
Act. Its primary purpose is to provide financial protection to contributors and their families in the event of retirement,
disability, or death. The program is funded through mandatory payroll deductions from employees, which are matched equally by
employers. These employee contributions are specifically referred to as Canada Pension Plan contributions.</p>
<p>In addition to the CPP, employers may offer private or non-government pension plans, which may also involve payroll
deductions from employees. The specific payroll withholding requirements for these supplementary pension plans will be discussed
in more detail in the later chapters; it is important to note that the CPP is often one of multiple retirement savings
vehicles available within an organization‚Äôs compensation structure.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Employers located in Quebec are responsible for deducting Qu√©bec Pension Plan (QPP) contributions, instead
of CPP contributions, from their Qu√©bec employees and remitting those contributions to Revenu Qu√©bec (RQ).</p>
</div>
<p>The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) was designed as an income replacement program for individuals who have been in pensionable
employment during their working life. A CPP retirement pension is a monthly benefit paid to people who have contributed to
the Canada Pension Plan. The pension is designed to replace about 25 percent of the earnings on which a person‚Äôs contributions
were based. Individuals can apply for their CPP retirement pension when they turn 60.</p>
<p>There are three Canada Pension Plan benefits:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>retirement pension</p></li>
<li><p>disability benefits (for contributors with a disability and their dependent children)</p></li>
<li><p>survivor benefits (including the death benefit, the survivor‚Äôs pension and the children‚Äôs benefit)</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The CPP operates throughout Canada while the province of Qu√©bec administers its own program for workers in Qu√©bec called the
<strong>Qu√©bec Pension Plan</strong> (QPP). The two plans work together to ensure that all contributors are protected, no matter where the
individual lives. Qu√©bec Pension Plan requirements will be covered later in this course.</p>
<section id="who-must-contribute-to-the-canada-pension-plan">
<h2><span class="section-number">4.1. </span>Who Must Contribute to the Canada Pension Plan<a class="headerlink" href="#who-must-contribute-to-the-canada-pension-plan" title="Link to this heading">¬∂</a></h2>
<p>The CPP is a <strong>contributory plan</strong>. This means that all costs are covered by the financial contributions paid by employees,
employers and self-employed workers, and from revenue earned on CPP investments. The CPP is not funded through general tax
revenues.</p>
<p>Canada Pension Plan contributions must be withheld from employees who:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>CPP contributions must be withheld from employees who have reached the age of 18 but are under the age of 70.</p></li>
<li><p>CPP contributions must be withheld from employees who are in pensionable employment.</p></li>
<li><p>CPP contributions must be withheld from employees in pensionable employment who are not considered to be disabled by either Service Canada or Retraite Qu√©bec.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>4. CPP contributions must be withheld from employees who are 65 years of age but are under the age of 70 and are in receipt of the Canada or Qu√©bec Pension Plan retirement
pension, but have not filed an election to stop paying CPP contributions.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In principle, employees who do not fall within the categories listed previously would not make CPP contributions. However, it
is not always clear what constitutes pensionable earnings and pensionable employment. To clarify eligibility, the CRA has
developed a list of the types of employment that are not subject to CPP contributions. This information can also be found in
the Employers‚Äô Guide - Payroll Deductions and Remittances - T4001, which is published by the CRA.</p>
<p>The following types of employment are excluded by legislation and therefore do not constitute pensionable employment. Payments arising from such employment are not subject
to CPP contributions:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>employment in agriculture, or an agricultural enterprise, horticulture, fishing, hunting, trapping, forestry, logging, or lumbering, by an employer:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>who pays the employee less than $250 in cash remuneration in a calendar year; or</p></li>
<li><p>employs the employee for a period of less than 25 working days in the same year on terms providing for payment of cash remuneration‚Äîthe working days do not have to be consecutive</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>employment of a casual nature other than for the purpose of the employer‚Äôs usual trade or business</p></li>
<li><p>employment of a person, other than as an entertainer, in connection with a circus, fair, parade, carnival, exposition, exhibition, or other similar activity, if that person is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>not regularly employed by that employer, and</p></li>
<li><p>employed by that employer for less than seven days in a year</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>employment of a person by a government body as an election worker, if that person:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>is not a regular employee of the government body, and</p></li>
<li><p>works for less than 35 hours in a calendar year</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>employment as a teacher on exchange from a foreign country</p></li>
<li><p>employment of a spouse or common-law partner if the employer cannot deduct the remuneration paid as an expense under the Income Tax Act</p></li>
<li><p>employment of a member of a religious order who has taken a vow of perpetual poverty. This applies whether the remuneration is paid directly to the order or paid by the member to the order.</p></li>
<li><p>employment for which no cash remuneration is paid, where the employee is the child of, or is maintained by, the employer</p></li>
<li><p>employment of a person who helps the employer in a disaster or in a rescue operation if the employee is not regularly employed by the employer</p></li>

<p><strong>Employment Insurance</strong> (EI) is a federally legislated social insurance program established under the Employment Insurance Act.
It provides temporary financial support to individuals who are unemployed while seeking new employment or engaging in skill
development. In addition to regular benefits, EI offers special provisions for workers who take leave due to significant life
events such as illness, pregnancy, caring for a newborn or newly adopted child, supporting a critically ill or injured person,
or tending to a family member facing a serious health condition with a risk of death.</p>
<p>The EI program is funded through payroll contributions made by employees, known as Employment Insurance premiums. Employers
also contribute by paying a premium that is calculated based on their employees‚Äô deductions.</p>
<p>While Employment Insurance is a government-mandated program, it may not be the only insurance plan available in the workplace.
Many organizations offer private or non-government insurance options such as life and disability coverage, which are funded by
employers, employees, or both. Although this chapter focuses specifically on the federally legislated EI program, additional
information about private insurance plans will be covered in the later chapters.</p>

<p>The <strong>Record of Employment</strong> (ROE) is the form used by Service Canada to determine an individual‚Äôs qualification to collect
Employment Insurance benefits when their employment is interrupted, how much the benefit will be and how long they will
collect it. As payroll is responsible for completing the ROE, the form will be illustrated in this chapter, along with an
explanation of what payroll information must be tracked for ROE reporting purposes.</p>
