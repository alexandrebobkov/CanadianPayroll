          Payroll is a necessary function in every organization that has employees,
as each employee expects to be paid for the work they perform. While the
amount of maximum remuneration that an employee receives for their work is
not legislated by any government (unless the employee is a federal or
provincial/territorial civil servant), there is legislation in place at
both the federal and provincial/territorial levels that governs many
aspects of processing employees&rsquo; pay, their taxable benefits and observing
their rights as employees.
         </p>
         <p>
          t is important to note that this course deals with payroll, the function of paying employees
for work performed for employers. Self-employed workers or contractors, who submit
invoices for the work they perform and receive payment through accounts payable and not
payroll, are not employees.
         </p>
         <p>
          Both the federal and the Qu&eacute;bec governments provide factors that can be used to determine
whether an employee-employer relationship exists. It is crucial to know how to determine the
type of relationship that exists between the worker and the organization and to ensure that
any payments made comply with legislation.

           The
           <strong>
            primary objective of the payroll function
           </strong>
           in every organization is to
pay employees accurately and on time, in compliance with legislative
requirements, for a full annual payroll cycle.
          </p>
          <p>
           Every employee expects to receive their pay on the day it is due in the
manner arranged with their employer, either by cheque or direct deposit.
In addition to ensuring that employees have been paid, payroll
practitioners must also be able to communicate payroll information to
all stakeholders.

             is the process of paying employees in exchange for the services they perform.

             <strong>
              Legislation
             </strong>
             refers to laws enacted by a legislative body. In Canada

           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           there are many legislative sources that payroll practitioners must comply
with at two separate levels: the federal and the provincial/territorial
governments. Later in the chapter we will explore the compliance
requirements for the various pieces of legislation from these sources.

           practitioners, this means performing payroll functions according to
federal and provincial/territorial legislative and non-governmental
stakeholder requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
           The legislative requirements are termed
           <strong>
            statutory
           </strong>
           . This means they are
enacted, created, or regulated by statute, a law enacted by the legislative
branch of a government. Fines and penalties can be imposed if an organization
is not in compliance with the legislative requirements in each jurisdiction.
          </p>
          <p>
           When dealing with federal and provincial/territorial government agencies,
payroll administrator must know the many pieces of legislation that
regulate their work and the compliance requirements associated with each.
Payroll administrators are responsible for ensuring their organization is
compliant with all payroll related legislation, thus eliminating the
potential for any fines or penalties.
          </p>
          <p>
           In payroll, there are also compliance requirements from other non-government stakeholders,
for example, union collective agreements or group insurance policies. Payroll administrator
must therefore ensure the organization is compliant with all stakeholder requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
           The responsibilities of the payroll administrator will differ depending on
the size of the organization, the number of jurisdictions in which they pay,
the reporting structure under which they work, and whether there are other
related departments, such as human resources, finance and administration in
the organization.
          </p>
          <p>
           Small and medium-sized organizations may have payroll administrators whose
positions include other functions that, in a larger organization, would
fall under other departments. This payroll practitioner may be required to
handle multiple tasks, such as employee recruitment, human resource policy
development, benefits administration, accounts payable, accounts receivable,
budgets and/or administration.
          </p>
          <p>
           Larger organizations may have a distinct payroll department with specific
payroll positions, in addition to separate human resources, accounting and
administration groups. Even in a multi-departmental organization, payroll
administrators must have knowledge of the various stages of the life cycle
of an employee. From hiring through termination of employment, many of
these stages will impact how to produce the employee&rsquo;s pay and prepare
required reports.

             Payroll Management Stakeholders
            </strong>
            are the federal and provincial/territorial governments,
the internal stakeholders and the external stakeholders. Internal stakeholders
include employees, employers and other departments within the organization.
External stakeholders include benefit carriers, courts, unions, pension
providers, charities, third party administrators and outsource/software vendors.

            Government legislation provides the rules and regulations that the payroll function must
administer with respect to payments made to employees. For this reason, it is important for
the payroll practitioner to understand both the scope and the source of payroll-related
legislation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Canada is ruled by a federal government with ten largely self-governing provinces and three
territories controlled by the federal government. Payroll practitioners have to be compliant
not only with the federal government legislation, but with the provincial and territorial
governments&rsquo; legislation as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a result, payroll practitioners and their organizations are affected by the enactment of
legislation at both the federal and provincial/territorial level.
The federal parliament has the power to make laws for the peace, order and good government
of Canada. The federal cabinet is responsible for most of the legislation introduced by
parliament, and has the sole power to prepare and introduce tax legislation involving the
expenditure of public money.
           </p>
           <p>
            The provincial/territorial legislatures have power over direct taxation in the province or
territory for the purposes of natural resources, prisons (except for federal penitentiaries),
charitable institutions, hospitals (except marine hospitals), municipal institutions, education,
licences for provincial/territorial and municipal revenue purposes, local works, incorporation
of provincial/territorial organizations, the creation of courts and the administration of justice,
fines and penalties for breaking provincial/territorial laws.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the case of old age, disability, and survivor&rsquo;s pensions, again both the federal and
provincial/territorial governments have power. In this instance, if their laws conflict, the
provincial/territorial power prevails.
           </p>
           <p>
            The federal government cannot transfer any of its powers to a provincial/territorial
legislature, nor can a provincial/territorial legislature transfer any of its powers to the federal
government. The federal government can, however, delegate the administration of a federal
act to a provincial/territorial agency, and a provincial/territorial legislature can delegate the
administration of a provincial/territorial act to a federal agency.

Part I deals with Industrial Relations, Part II deals with Occupational Health and Safety and
Part III deals with Labour Standards. The primary objective of Part III is to establish and

            The existing divisions between federal and provincial/territorial control impact payroll when
dealing with employment/labour standards. Employment/labour standards are rules legislated
by each provincial/territorial jurisdiction that dictate issues such as hours of work, minimum
wage, overtime, vacation pay and termination pay requirements.
           </p>
           <p>
            Employers must follow the employment/labour standards legislated by the jurisdiction in
which their employees work, unless they are governed by federal labour standards. Federal
labour standards apply to certain industries and organizations, regardless of where the
employees work.
           </p>
           <p>
            The person or persons performing the payroll function must clearly understand under which
employment/labour standards jurisdiction the employees of the organization fall.
Organizations may have some employees who fall under federal jurisdiction and another
group of employees who fall under provincial/territorial legislation.

            Internal stakeholders are those individuals or departments closely related to the organization
that the payroll department is serving. This group includes employers, employees and other
departments in the organization.
           </p>
           <p>
            Employers - Management may require certain information from payroll to make sound
business decisions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Employees - Employees require that their pay is received in a timely and accurate manner to
meet personal obligations. Employees must also be assured that their personal information is
kept confidential.
           </p>
           <p>
            Other departments - Many departments interact with payroll, either for information or
reporting. According to the Canadian Payroll Association&rsquo;s 2020 National Payroll Week
(NPW) Payroll Professional Research Survey, fifty-five percent of payroll practitioners
report through the finance department and thirty-two percent report through the human
resources department.
           </p>
           <p>
            Information such as general ledger posting, payroll and benefit costs
and salary information must flow between payroll, human resources and finance in formats
needed for their various requirements.
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition, other departments such as contracts and manufacturing often need payroll
information for budgeting, analytical and quality purposes.

           <p>
            External stakeholders are organizations that are neither government nor internal stakeholders,
yet have a close working relationship with the payroll function. Compliance with external
stakeholder requirements is also a responsibility of the payroll department. In most cases,
compliance will require that payroll request a cheque from accounts payable and send it to
the external organization along with supporting documentation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Benefit Carriers are insurance companies that provide benefit coverage to employees.
Payroll is responsible for deducting and remitting premiums for the insurance coverage to the
carriers and for providing reports on employee enrolment and coverage levels.
           </p>
           <p>
            Courts and the CRA require payroll to accurately deduct and remit amounts ordered to be
withheld through garnishments, third party demands, requirements to pay and support
deduction orders.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Unions
            </strong>
            require that payroll accurately deduct and remit union dues and initiation fees, and to
ensure that the terms of the collective agreement are adhered to. It is estimated that just under
one-third of the workforce in Canada belongs to a trade union. Payroll professionals must be
familiar with the role and activities of trade unions and the responsibilities of the employer
and the payroll department in a unionized environment.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trade unions negotiate with the employer, through collective bargaining, the wages, benefits,
allowances and other terms and conditions of employment on behalf of their member
employees. The outcome of negotiations is a collective agreement, which is a legally binding
contract between the employer, the union and the employees.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Pension Providers
            </strong>
            are third party pension plan providers that may require payroll to provide
enrolment reports on participating employees and length of service calculations, and to remit
employee deductions and employer contributions.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Charities
            </strong>
            have arrangements with some organizations to facilitate employee donations
through payroll deductions. Payroll is responsible for remitting these deductions to the
charity.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Third Party Administrators
            </strong>
            are organizations that affect the administration of the payroll
function. Examples of these external stakeholders are banking institutions or benefit
organizations that offer Group Registered Retirement Saving Plans (RRSP). Payroll is
responsible for deducting any employee contributions and remitting employer and employee
contributions to the plan administrator.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Outsource/Software vendors
            </strong>
            are payroll service providers or payroll software vendors that
work with the payroll department to ensure the payroll is being processed accurately and
efficiently.

           The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is a federal government agency that manages the
following business lines for the federal government: Tax Services and Benefit Programs.
The Tax Services business line assists over 25 million individuals, businesses, trusts, and
organizations to meet their obligations under the tax system. Each year, the CRA collects
approximately $324 billion in gross taxes and excise duties on behalf of the federal and
provincial governments - the equivalent of about $1.2 billion every working day. The CRA&rsquo;s
mission is to promote compliance with Canada&rsquo;s tax legislation and regulations through
communication, quality service, and responsible enforcement, thereby contributing to the
economic and social well-being of Canadians.
          </p>
          <p>
           From this mission comes the CRA&rsquo;s mandate to:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <div>

           Each of these programs requires compliance by employers to withhold deductions from their
employees&rsquo; pay for CPP contributions, EI premiums and income tax deductions. These
withholdings are termed statutory deductions as the deductions are required under legislative
statute. Statutory deductions are the first deductions to be withheld from an employee&rsquo;s gross
pay.

            The CRA&rsquo;s responsibility for the Employment Insurance program is associated with the
collection of employee and employer premiums. It also makes decisions about which types of
remuneration are considered insurable and, therefore, subject to EI premiums.
All employers are required by law to deduct EI premiums from the insurable earnings paid to
their employees, and remit these deductions, along with the employer&rsquo;s portion, to the CRA.
The employer&rsquo;s portion is 1.4 times the employee&rsquo;s portion.

           <p>
            Income taxation began in Canada, and in many other countries, during World War I. In July
1917, the Government of Canada passed legislation which enabled the government to levy a
temporary tax on personal income. This tax was intended to help finance government
expenditures for World War I; however, it eventually became the basic tax on all incomes.
           </p>
           <p>
            When income tax was first introduced, each person was responsible for paying their own
income tax directly to the federal government. In 1940, the federal government legislated
deductions at source, which meant that employers became responsible for withholding
income tax from remuneration paid to employees. Beginning January 1, 1962, all provinces
imposed personal income tax; prior to that date, only Qu&eacute;bec imposed such a tax.
           </p>
           <p>
            Income tax withholdings are calculated by applying a federal tax rate and a separate
provincial/territorial tax rate to the employee&rsquo;s taxable income. The employee&rsquo;s province of
employment determines which provincial/territorial tax rate to apply. The federal
government and all provinces and territories, except Qu&eacute;bec, have the same definition of
taxable income.
           </p>
           <p>
            All Canadian provinces/territories, except Qu&eacute;bec, have entered into tax collection
agreements with the federal government. Under these agreements the CRA collects the
provincial/territorial income taxes on behalf of the provinces/territories. The CRA then
distributes the provincial/territorial income taxes it has collected through a series of transfer
payments to the provinces/territories. These transfer payments are based on the personal tax
returns filed by Canadian taxpayers.
           </p>
           <p>
            As the federal government collects both the federal and the provincial/territorial portions of
tax from all employees working in a province/territory other than Qu&eacute;bec, the two tax
withholdings, federal and provincial/territorial, are combined into one deduction amount. The
employee may only see one item
            <em>
             Income Tax
            </em>
            or
            <em>
             Federal Income Tax
            </em>
            listed on their pay
statement, however it is the total of two withholdings.
           </p>
           <p>
            Qu&eacute;bec collects its own provincial income tax. There are two separate income tax deductions
withheld from Qu&eacute;bec employees &mdash; one for federal income tax and the other for Qu&eacute;bec
provincial income tax. The federal income tax is remitted to the CRA and the Qu&eacute;bec
provincial income tax is remitted to Revenu Qu&eacute;bec (RQ). Qu&eacute;bec employees will see
            <em>
             Federal Income Tax
            </em>
            and
            <em>
             Qu&eacute;bec Income Tax
            </em>
            listed separately on their pay statements.
RQ is discussed extensively in a later chapter.

and interest charges on the outstanding amount.

           An employer who remits withholdings or deductions late is subject to the following

          <p>
           An employer who withholds the statutory deductions but does not remit them, or fails to
deduct the required deductions, will be subject to a 10% penalty for the first occurrence on
the amount that should have been deducted and remitted. This penalty may increase to 20%
for the second and each subsequent occurrence in the same calendar year if the failure was
made knowingly or under circumstances of gross negligence. Penalties will be applied to
amounts in excess of $500; however, in the case of wilful delay or deficiency, these penalties
can be levied on amounts of less than $500.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) charges interest on any unpaid remittances and unpaid
penalties from the day the payment was due. The interest rate is determined every three
months, in accordance with the prescribed interest rates, and is available on the CRA
website.
          </p>
          <p>
           As a payroll practitioner, you need to have a clear understanding of how and when to make
the required deductions and remittances to avoid these penalties and interest charges.
          </p>
          <p>
           All monies deducted on behalf of the CRA are considered to be held &ldquo;in trust&rdquo; for the
Receiver General. The amount owed must be kept separate from the operating funds of the
organization. In the event of estate liquidation, assignment, receivership, or bankruptcy the
trust money for statutory deductions is still owed to the CRA.

           Almost all of today&rsquo;s seniors receive income from Canada&rsquo;s public pensions. Basic financial
support is also available to survivors, people who become too disabled to work, and their
children. These pensions and benefits are delivered through the Canada Pension Plan (CPP)
and Old Age Security (OAS) programs. Together, the CPP and OAS programs provide a
modest base upon which Canadians can build their retirement income.
          </p>
          <p>
           The amount of CPP benefits is based on an individual&rsquo;s CPP contributions. Employees
between the ages of 18 to 70 years old make contributions that are calculated on their annual
pensionable earnings between a minimum and a maximum amount. The minimum amount is
frozen at $3,500, while the maximum pensionable earnings are set each January, based on
increases in the average wage in Canada.
          </p>
          <p>
           Employment Insurance (EI) is the program with the greatest impact on payroll. This program
provides temporary financial assistance for unemployed Canadians while they look for work
or upgrade their skills. It also provides coverage for Canadians who are sick, pregnant or
caring for a newborn or adopted child. Individuals who must care for a family member who
is seriously ill with a significant risk of death may also be assisted by Employment Insurance
benefits. Application of the EI rules will be looked at in more detail in another chapter.
The first Unemployment Insurance (UI) Act was passed into law in 1940, and was based on
the British Unemployment Insurance Act, 1935. Since that time, the UI Act has been repealed
and replaced four times - in 1955, 1971, 1985, and most recently in 1996. Clarifying details
on how the act is to be applied are found in the EI Regulations, which are amended as
required.
          </p>
          <p>
           The purpose of the act is to provide income support during a temporary interruption of
earnings with the emphasis on returning the unemployed to the labour force as quickly as
possible. Contributions to the plan and the amount of benefits are based on a percentage of
insurable earnings. The ceiling on insurable earnings is reviewed annually to keep pace with
increases in average income and the cost of living. The premium rates payable by an insured
employee and the employer are also determined annually.

           Service Canada (SC) was created by the federal government in 2005 with the goal of
providing easy-to-access, one-stop personalized service to Canadians. The agency integrates
services from a number of federal departments to form a service delivery network. These
services often touch all aspects of the lives of Canadians: from parental and pension benefits,
to matching employers with job seekers, and obtaining a Social Insurance Number.
Service Canada serves as the government&rsquo;s operational arm while Employment and Social
Development Canada (ESDC) operates as the policy-making body. ESDC makes the rules
for the various programs while Service Canada delivers the programs.

           Determining the nature of the working relationship between an individual and an organization is essential in all employment situations. Whether the individual is classified as an employee or self-employed directly affects the statutory withholding requirements and the organization&rsquo;s compliance with applicable legislation. To support this assessment, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) provides a set of guidelines designed to help distinguish between the two classifications. Importantly, the decision is not made by the worker but must be based on objective criteria and legal standards.
          </p>
          <p>
           Payroll practitioners play an important role in promoting awareness of this distinction throughout the organization. By proactively communicating the significance of establishing a valid employee-employer relationship, payroll professionals help ensure that employment classifications are accurate and compliant.
          </p>
          <p>
           Once an employee-employer relationship is confirmed, the payroll department becomes responsible for meeting compliance obligations related to statutory withholdings. This includes deducting the appropriate amounts&mdash;such as income tax, Canada Pension Plan contributions, and Employment Insurance premiums&mdash;from employee pay and remitting them to the government within the required timelines. Proper classification and adherence to these rules are key to maintaining legal and financial accountability.
          </p>
          <p>
           Where an employee-employer relationship exists, the CRA requires the employer to:

            A
            <strong>
             contract for service
            </strong>
            is a business relationship whereby one party agrees to perform certain
specific work stipulated in the contract for another party. It usually calls for the
accomplishment of a clearly defined task but does not normally require that the contracting
party do anything him/herself. A person who carries out a contract for service may be
considered a contract worker, a self-employed person or an independent contractor.
           </p>
           <p>
            A business relationship is formed when a self-employed individual enters into a verbal or written agreement to complete
specific work for a payer in exchange for compensation. This arrangement does not establish an employer-employee relationship;
instead, it represents a contract for services.
           </p>
           <p>
            Under this type of agreement, the self-employed individual is responsible for delivering a final result within an agreed
timeframe, using methods of their own choosing. They are not subject to the direction or supervision of the payer while
completing the work, and they retain autonomy over how tasks are executed. In most cases, the payer does not participate in
or influence the work process, meaning control over the work lies entirely with the self-employed individual. This structure
reflects a high level of independence and flexibility, distinguishing it clearly from traditional employment relationships.
           </p>
           <p>
            Under a contract for service, a self-employed individual accepts both the potential for profit and the risk of financial loss.
Prior to engagement, the individual agrees on the total cost of the work, uses personal tools and equipment, and assumes full
responsibility for how the work is performed. This means the individual bears any unforeseen costs or challenges that arise
during the project. Conversely, if the work is completed more efficiently than expected, the financial gain&mdash;through retained
profits&mdash;is greater.
           </p>
           <p>
            Organizations often utilize contracts for service when they require tasks or projects that fall outside their normal business
operations. While the relationship between a payer and a self-employed contractor may resemble that of an employer and
employee, there is a key distinction. In a contract for service, the payer specifies the desired outcome or deliverable, but
not how the work should be completed. In contrast, a contract of service allows the employer to direct both the tasks and the
method by which they are carried out, establishing a more controlled, employee-based relationship.
           </p>
           <p>
            Under a contract for service, the payer exercises general oversight to ensure that the agreed work is completed as specified.
However, this oversight does not extend to controlling how the work is performed. The self-employed individual retains
autonomy over the methods used to complete the tasks. Receiving general instructions from a project manager or similar
representative does not establish an employer-employee relationship.
           </p>
           <p>
            An employee-employer relationship is recognized when an organization has the authority to direct and control both the work and
the manner in which it is performed. If there is uncertainty about whether such a relationship exists, the Canada Revenue
Agency (CRA) recommends submitting Form CPT1 &mdash; Request for a CPP/EI Ruling: Employee or Self-Employed? &mdash; to obtain
clarification. A sample of this form can be found at the end of this section.
           </p>
           <p>
            Independent contractors or self-employed individuals are not classified as employees if no employer-employee relationship is
present. They typically submit invoices and receive payment through accounts payable. However, the act of submitting an
invoice alone is not sufficient to confirm self-employment status. Proper assessment of the working relationship is essential
sto ensure accurate classification and compliance with tax and labor regulations.

           The CRA uses a two-step approach to examine the relationship between the worker and the
payer for relationships outside the province of Qu&eacute;bec. The approach used for relationships
in the province of Qu&eacute;bec will be discussed in a later chapter.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Step 1:
           </strong>
           The first step is to establish what the intent was when the worker and the payer entered into
the working arrangement. Did they intend to enter into an employee-employer relationship
(contract of service) or did they intend to enter into a business relationship (contract for
service). The CRA must determine not only how the working relationship has been defined
but why it was defined that way.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Step 2:
           </strong>
           The CRA then considers certain factors when determining if a contract of service or a
contract for service exists. In order to understand the working relationship and verify that the
intent of the worker and the payer is reflected in the facts, they will ask a series of questions
that relate to the following factors:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <div>

             <li>
              <p>
               whether or not the worker provides the tools and equipment

            </ul>
           </div>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           The CRA will look at the answers independently and then together and consider whether or
not they reflect the intent that was originally stated. Considered individually, the response to
each of these questions is not conclusive; however, when weighed together, certain
conclusions may be drawn. When there is no common intent, the CRA will decide if the
answers are more consistent with a contract of service or a contract for service.
Each of these factors will be discussed in the material and indicators showing whether the
worker is an employee or self-employed will be provided.

            One of the key factors in determining a worker&rsquo;s status is the extent to which the payer has the ability, authority, or
right to control both what work is performed and how it is carried out. Equally important is the level of independence the
worker maintains in performing their duties.

           <p>
            In evaluating the relationship, both the payer&rsquo;s oversight of the worker&rsquo;s day-to-day activities and their overall
influence are assessed. However, it is the payer&rsquo;s right to exercise control&mdash;rather than whether that control is actively
used&mdash;that holds the most weight in determining the nature of the working relationship.

           <p>
            Ownership of tools and equipment is not a definitive factor in determining the nature of a working relationship or the type
of contract in place. While self-employed individuals often use their own tools to fulfill contractual obligations&mdash;making
such ownership common in business relationships&mdash;this alone does not confirm self-employment. Employees may also be required
to supply their own tools, depending on the trade or occupation.
           </p>
           <p>
            In typical employee-employer relationships, the employer provides the necessary equipment and assumes the costs associated
with its use, including maintenance, insurance, transportation, rental fees, and operational expenses such as fuel. However,
in certain industries&mdash;such as automotive repair, painting, carpentry, and technical fields like software development or
surveying&mdash;it is standard practice for employees to use their own tools or specialized instruments.
           </p>
           <p>
            In contrast, self-employed individuals not only supply their own equipment but also bear the associated costs. Significant
financial investment in tools&mdash;especially those that require ongoing maintenance or replacement&mdash;can suggest a business
relationship, as these individuals assume both the potential for profit and the risk of loss.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ultimately, the key consideration is the scale of the investment and the financial responsibility related to repairs,
replacement, and insurance, rather than mere ownership itself.

            When evaluating the nature of a working relationship, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) considers whether the individual
incurs fixed, ongoing costs or unreimbursed expenses. In traditional employee arrangements, employers typically reimburse
expenses that arise as part of the job&mdash;for example, travel or business-related costs.
           </p>
           <p>
            In contrast, self-employed individuals often assume greater financial risk by covering recurring operational costs
regardless of whether active work is being performed. These may include equipment leasing, office space rental, or other
business overheads. While both employees and contractors may receive reimbursement for certain expenses, the CRA places
particular emphasis on identifying costs that are not reimbursed. The presence of such expenses may indicate a business
relationship, reflecting the independence and financial responsibility characteristic of self-employment.

            When assessing whether a business relationship exists, one important indicator is the worker&rsquo;s financial investment in the
services they provide. If an individual is required to invest in equipment, materials, or other resources to complete the
work, this suggests the presence of a contract for service rather than an employment relationship.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another key factor is decision-making authority related to financial outcomes. When the worker independently makes business
decisions that influence their profit or loss&mdash;such as pricing, project selection, or service delivery methods&mdash;it further
supports the classification of a self-employed individual operating under a business arrangement. These characteristics
reflect the autonomy and financial risk typically associated with self-employment.

           <p>
            A business relationship is often indicated when a worker has the ability to realize a profit or incur a loss, reflecting their
control over the financial and operational aspects of the services they provide. Self-employed individuals typically
negotiate their own rates, choose which contracts to accept, and may take on multiple contracts simultaneously. To fulfill
contractual obligations, they often incur and manage expenses, which directly influence their potential for profit.
           </p>
           <p>
            In contrast, employees generally do not bear financial risk or benefit from profit. While commission-based employees may
increase their earnings through performance, this does not represent profit in the traditional sense, as it does not reflect
income earned beyond expenses. Moreover, employees do not typically share in a business&rsquo;s profits or losses.
           </p>
           <p>
            When assessing worker classification, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) considers the extent to which the individual controls
their revenue and expenses. Another key factor is the method of payment: employees are usually compensated at a fixed rate
based on a consistent pay schedule (e.g., hourly, weekly, or annually). Self-employed individuals, however, are often paid a
flat rate for a specific job, especially when they absorb related costs&mdash;an arrangement that commonly signals a business
relationship.
           </p>
           <p>
            The worker is an employee when:

          <p>
           Employment relationships are defined through contractual arrangements. A contract of service refers to a traditional
employer-employee relationship, where an individual commits to working for an employer&mdash;either on a full-time or part-time
basis&mdash;for a specified or ongoing period. The employer has authority over both the duties and how they are executed.
          </p>
          <p>
           Conversely, a contract for service reflects a business arrangement where an independent contractor agrees to perform specific
tasks, with discretion over how the work is completed. This signifies a client-provider relationship rather than an employment
one.
          </p>
          <p>
           To assess worker classification&mdash;particularly outside Qu&eacute;bec&mdash;the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) employs a two-step evaluation. Key
considerations include:
          </p>
          <p>
           Control: Whether the payer holds the right to determine what work is done and how it is executed.
          </p>
          <p>
           Independence: The degree of autonomy exercised by the worker.
          </p>
          <p>
           Ownership of Tools: Significant investment in tools and equipment, along with maintenance and insurance responsibilities, may indicate a business relationship.
          </p>
          <p>
           Financial Risk: Ongoing operational costs or unreimbursed expenses reflect a higher likelihood of self-employment.
          </p>
          <p>
           Revenue Control: The ability to manage pricing, accept multiple contracts, and influence earnings supports classification under a contract for service.
          </p>
          <p>
           Collectively, these factors guide proper categorization for legal and tax purposes, helping organizations ensure compliance and mitigate potential risk.

         Membership or participation in the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Employment Insurance
Plan (EI) is compulsory for certain types of employment. As a person responsible for the payroll
you need to know which employees must participate in these plans, what amounts to withhold
from employees and how much the employer will have to remit or send to the Canada
Revenue Agency (CRA).
        </p>
        <p>
         Payroll plays a pivotal role in administering statutory deductions, specifically the collection and remittance of
Canada Pension Plan (CPP) contributions and Employment Insurance (EI) premiums. These mandatory deductions, along with the
employer&rsquo;s matching portion, must be accurately submitted to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) within prescribed timelines.
        </p>
        <p>
         This chapter outlines the essential criteria used to identify pensionable and insurable earnings, and provides detailed
guidance on calculating both employee deductions and employer contributions for regular and non-regular pay periods.
        </p>
        <p>
         In accordance with federal legislation, CPP contributions are the
         <strong>
          first deduction
         </strong>
         applied to employment income,
followed by EI premiums. Because these deductions are mandated by statute, they are classified as
         <strong>
          statutory deductions
         </strong>
         ,
underscoring their legal significance and the employer&rsquo;s obligation to ensure full compliance.

          The
          <strong>
           Canada Pension Plan
          </strong>
          (CPP) is a federally legislated social insurance program established under the Canada Pension Plan
Act. Its primary purpose is to provide financial protection to contributors and their families in the event of retirement,
disability, or death. The program is funded through mandatory payroll deductions from employees, which are matched equally by
employers. These employee contributions are specifically referred to as Canada Pension Plan contributions.
         </p>
         <p>
          In addition to the CPP, employers may offer private or non-government pension plans, which may also involve payroll
deductions from employees. The specific payroll withholding requirements for these supplementary pension plans will be discussed
in more detail in the later chapters; it is important to note that the CPP is often one of multiple retirement savings
vehicles available within an organization&rsquo;s compensation structure.

           Note

          <p>
           Employers located in Quebec are responsible for deducting Qu&eacute;bec Pension Plan (QPP) contributions, instead
of CPP contributions, from their Qu&eacute;bec employees and remitting those contributions to Revenu Qu&eacute;bec (RQ).
          </p>
         </div>
         <p>
          The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) was designed as an income replacement program for individuals who have been in pensionable
employment during their working life. A CPP retirement pension is a monthly benefit paid to people who have contributed to
the Canada Pension Plan. The pension is designed to replace about 25 percent of the earnings on which a person&rsquo;s contributions
were based. Individuals can apply for their CPP retirement pension when they turn 60.
         </p>
         <p>
          There are three Canada Pension Plan benefits:

            <li>
             <p>
              survivor benefits (including the death benefit, the survivor&rsquo;s pension and the children&rsquo;s benefit)

         <p>
          The CPP operates throughout Canada while the province of Qu&eacute;bec administers its own program for workers in Qu&eacute;bec called the
          <strong>
           Qu&eacute;bec Pension Plan
          </strong>
          (QPP). The two plans work together to ensure that all contributors are protected, no matter where the
individual lives. Qu&eacute;bec Pension Plan requirements will be covered later in this course.

           The CPP is a
           <strong>
            contributory plan
           </strong>
           . This means that all costs are covered by the financial contributions paid by employees,
employers and self-employed workers, and from revenue earned on CPP investments. The CPP is not funded through general tax
revenues.
          </p>
          <p>
           Canada Pension Plan contributions must be withheld from employees who:

pension, but have not filed an election to stop paying CPP contributions.

          <p>
           In principle, employees who do not fall within the categories listed previously would not make CPP contributions. However, it
is not always clear what constitutes pensionable earnings and pensionable employment. To clarify eligibility, the CRA has
developed a list of the types of employment that are not subject to CPP contributions. This information can also be found in
the Employers&rsquo; Guide - Payroll Deductions and Remittances - T4001, which is published by the CRA.

           The following types of employment are excluded by legislation and therefore do not constitute pensionable employment. Payments arising from such employment are not subject

          <strong>
           Employment Insurance
          </strong>
          (EI) is a federally legislated social insurance program established under the Employment Insurance Act.
It provides temporary financial support to individuals who are unemployed while seeking new employment or engaging in skill
development. In addition to regular benefits, EI offers special provisions for workers who take leave due to significant life
events such as illness, pregnancy, caring for a newborn or newly adopted child, supporting a critically ill or injured person,
or tending to a family member facing a serious health condition with a risk of death.
         </p>
         <p>
          The EI program is funded through payroll contributions made by employees, known as Employment Insurance premiums. Employers
also contribute by paying a premium that is calculated based on their employees&rsquo; deductions.
         </p>
         <p>
          While Employment Insurance is a government-mandated program, it may not be the only insurance plan available in the workplace.
Many organizations offer private or non-government insurance options such as life and disability coverage, which are funded by
employers, employees, or both. Although this chapter focuses specifically on the federally legislated EI program, additional
information about private insurance plans will be covered in the later chapters.

           To enter a new employee into the Sage 50 Payroll module (Canada edition), start by navigating to the Employees &amp; Payroll section in the
Home window. Right-click the Employees icon and choose &ldquo;Add Employee&rdquo; to begin creating employee&rsquo;s record. Input the employee&rsquo;s full legal
name. Then, proceed to fill in the personal and payroll details across several tabs: the Personal tab for birth date and contact info, the Taxes tab to select the appropriate provincial
tax table, the Income tab to configure their pay frequency, and the Deductions tab to define benefit or pension deductions. You&rsquo;ll also
want to enter their bank details for direct deposit. For compliance, be sure to complete and store signed TD1 forms (Federal and Provincial)
separately, as Sage50 does not automatically generate these. You&rsquo;ll also need to set up EI, CPP, and Income Tax deductions and link them to remittance vendors in the system. Once all
information is reviewed for accuracy, save and close the record to finalize setup. If you prefer a guided approach, Sage50 also offers
an Employee Wizard to walk you through these steps.

            To maintain accuracy and compliance in Sage 50 Payroll, carefully verify that all employee information entered into the system,
including full legal name, Social Insurance Number (SIN), residential address, and compensation details, matches the data provided on
official documentation such as the signed employment contract and government-issued identification (e.g. driver&rsquo;s licence, Employment Contract).
Double-checking these entries helps prevent administrative errors and ensures that payroll records remain consistent with legal and
regulatory standards.

              <em>
               Accurately entering the &ldquo;Date Hired&rdquo; in Sage 50 is a critical step in ensuring the integrity of payroll records and overall HR
compliance. This field defines the employee&rsquo;s official start date, which determines pay cycle alignment, benefit entitlement periods,
and the correct application of mandatory deductions such as CPP and EI. It also plays a pivotal role in historical payroll
reporting&mdash;including audit readiness and the generation of year-end T4 slips. Furthermore, the hire date is essential when preparing a
Record of Employment (ROE), as it establishes the starting point for the employee&rsquo;s insurable earnings and service duration.

            Payroll accounting is a critical component of the Canadian Payroll Administration system. It involves the systematic recording, analysis, and reporting of payroll transactions to ensure that all financial aspects of employee compensation are accurately reflected in the organization&rsquo;s financial statements.
Payroll accounting includes the management of employee wages, tax withholdings, benefit deductions, and other payroll-related expenses. The system is designed to automate these processes, ensuring accuracy and compliance with Canadian payroll regulations.

            Journal entries are a key part of payroll accounting, as they document the financial impact of payroll transactions on the organization&rsquo;s accounts. Each payroll run generates a series of journal entries that reflect the distribution of wages, taxes, and deductions across various accounts.
These entries are essential for maintaining accurate financial records and ensuring that the organization&rsquo;s financial statements reflect the true cost of employee compensation. The Canadian Payroll Administration system automates the generation of these journal entries, reducing the risk of errors and ensuring compliance with accounting standards.
