         Membership or participation in the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Employment Insurance
Plan (EI) is compulsory for certain types of employment. As a person responsible for the payroll
you need to know which employees must participate in these plans, what amounts to withhold
from employees and how much the employer will have to remit or send to the Canada
Revenue Agency (CRA).
        </p>
        <p>
         Payroll plays a pivotal role in administering statutory deductions, specifically the collection and remittance of
Canada Pension Plan (CPP) contributions and Employment Insurance (EI) premiums. These mandatory deductions, along with the
employer&rsquo;s matching portion, must be accurately submitted to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) within prescribed timelines.
        </p>
        <p>
         This chapter outlines the essential criteria used to identify pensionable and insurable earnings, and provides detailed
guidance on calculating both employee deductions and employer contributions for regular and non-regular pay periods.
        </p>
        <p>
         In accordance with federal legislation, CPP contributions are the
         <strong>
          first deduction
         </strong>
         applied to employment income,
followed by EI premiums. Because these deductions are mandated by statute, they are classified as
         <strong>
          statutory deductions
         </strong>
         ,
underscoring their legal significance and the employer&rsquo;s obligation to ensure full compliance.

          The
          <strong>
           Canada Pension Plan
          </strong>
          (CPP) is a federally legislated social insurance program established under the Canada Pension Plan
Act. Its primary purpose is to provide financial protection to contributors and their families in the event of retirement,
disability, or death. The program is funded through mandatory payroll deductions from employees, which are matched equally by
employers. These employee contributions are specifically referred to as Canada Pension Plan contributions.
         </p>
         <p>
          In addition to the CPP, employers may offer private or non-government pension plans, which may also involve payroll
deductions from employees. The specific payroll withholding requirements for these supplementary pension plans will be discussed
in more detail in the later chapters; it is important to note that the CPP is often one of multiple retirement savings
vehicles available within an organization&rsquo;s compensation structure.

          <p>
           Employers located in Quebec are responsible for deducting Qu&eacute;bec Pension Plan (QPP) contributions, instead
of CPP contributions, from their Qu&eacute;bec employees and remitting those contributions to Revenu Qu&eacute;bec (RQ).
          </p>
         </div>
         <p>
          The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) was designed as an income replacement program for individuals who have been in pensionable
employment during their working life. A CPP retirement pension is a monthly benefit paid to people who have contributed to
the Canada Pension Plan. The pension is designed to replace about 25 percent of the earnings on which a person&rsquo;s contributions
were based. Individuals can apply for their CPP retirement pension when they turn 60.
         </p>
         <p>
          There are three Canada Pension Plan benefits:
         </p>
         <blockquote>

            <li>
             <p>
              disability benefits (for contributors with a disability and their dependent children)

            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              survivor benefits (including the death benefit, the survivor&rsquo;s pension and the children&rsquo;s benefit)

         <p>
          The CPP operates throughout Canada while the province of Qu&eacute;bec administers its own program for workers in Qu&eacute;bec called the
          <strong>
           Qu&eacute;bec Pension Plan
          </strong>
          (QPP). The two plans work together to ensure that all contributors are protected, no matter where the
individual lives. Qu&eacute;bec Pension Plan requirements will be covered later in this course.

           The CPP is a
           <strong>
            contributory plan
           </strong>
           . This means that all costs are covered by the financial contributions paid by employees,
employers and self-employed workers, and from revenue earned on CPP investments. The CPP is not funded through general tax
revenues.
          </p>
          <p>
           Canada Pension Plan contributions must be withheld from employees who:

           In principle, employees who do not fall within the categories listed previously would not make CPP contributions. However, it
is not always clear what constitutes pensionable earnings and pensionable employment. To clarify eligibility, the CRA has
developed a list of the types of employment that are not subject to CPP contributions. This information can also be found in
the Employers&rsquo; Guide - Payroll Deductions and Remittances - T4001, which is published by the CRA.
          </p>

           The following types of employment are excluded by legislation and therefore do not constitute pensionable employment. Payments arising from such employment are not subject

          <strong>
           Employment Insurance
          </strong>
          (EI) is a federally legislated social insurance program established under the Employment Insurance Act.
It provides temporary financial support to individuals who are unemployed while seeking new employment or engaging in skill
development. In addition to regular benefits, EI offers special provisions for workers who take leave due to significant life
events such as illness, pregnancy, caring for a newborn or newly adopted child, supporting a critically ill or injured person,
or tending to a family member facing a serious health condition with a risk of death.
         </p>
         <p>
          The EI program is funded through payroll contributions made by employees, known as Employment Insurance premiums. Employers
also contribute by paying a premium that is calculated based on their employees&rsquo; deductions.
         </p>
         <p>
          While Employment Insurance is a government-mandated program, it may not be the only insurance plan available in the workplace.
Many organizations offer private or non-government insurance options such as life and disability coverage, which are funded by
employers, employees, or both. Although this chapter focuses specifically on the federally legislated EI program, additional
information about private insurance plans will be covered in the later chapters.

           To enter a new employee into the Sage 50 Payroll module (Canada edition), start by navigating to the Employees &amp; Payroll section in the
Home window. Right-click the Employees icon and choose &ldquo;Add Employee&rdquo; to begin creating employee&rsquo;s record. Input the employee&rsquo;s full legal
name. Then, proceed to fill in the personal and payroll details across several tabs: the Personal tab for birth date and contact info, the Taxes tab to select the appropriate provincial
tax table, the Income tab to configure their pay frequency, and the Deductions tab to define benefit or pension deductions. You&rsquo;ll also
want to enter their bank details for direct deposit. For compliance, be sure to complete and store signed TD1 forms (Federal and Provincial)
separately, as Sage50 does not automatically generate these. You&rsquo;ll also need to set up EI, CPP, and Income Tax deductions and link them to remittance vendors in the system. Once all
information is reviewed for accuracy, save and close the record to finalize setup. If you prefer a guided approach, Sage50 also offers
an Employee Wizard to walk you through these steps.

            To maintain accuracy and compliance in Sage 50 Payroll, carefully verify that all employee information entered into the system,
including full legal name, Social Insurance Number (SIN), residential address, and compensation details, matches the data provided on
official documentation such as the signed employment contract and government-issued identification (e.g. driver&rsquo;s licence, Employment Contract).
Double-checking these entries helps prevent administrative errors and ensures that payroll records remain consistent with legal and
regulatory standards.

              What is the significance of accurately entering the &ldquo;Date Hired&rdquo; field when setting up a new employee profile in Sage 50?

             <p>
              <em>
               Accurately entering the &ldquo;Date Hired&rdquo; in Sage 50 is a critical step in ensuring the integrity of payroll records and overall HR
compliance. This field defines the employee&rsquo;s official start date, which determines pay cycle alignment, benefit entitlement periods,
and the correct application of mandatory deductions such as CPP and EI. It also plays a pivotal role in historical payroll
reporting&mdash;including audit readiness and the generation of year-end T4 slips. Furthermore, the hire date is essential when preparing a
Record of Employment (ROE), as it establishes the starting point for the employee&rsquo;s insurable earnings and service duration.

            Payroll accounting is a critical component of the Canadian Payroll Administration system. It involves the systematic recording, analysis, and reporting of payroll transactions to ensure that all financial aspects of employee compensation are accurately reflected in the organization&rsquo;s financial statements.
Payroll accounting includes the management of employee wages, tax withholdings, benefit deductions, and other payroll-related expenses. The system is designed to automate these processes, ensuring accuracy and compliance with Canadian payroll regulations.

            Journal entries are a key part of payroll accounting, as they document the financial impact of payroll transactions on the organization&rsquo;s accounts. Each payroll run generates a series of journal entries that reflect the distribution of wages, taxes, and deductions across various accounts.
These entries are essential for maintaining accurate financial records and ensuring that the organization&rsquo;s financial statements reflect the true cost of employee compensation. The Canadian Payroll Administration system automates the generation of these journal entries, reducing the risk of errors and ensuring compliance with accounting standards.
